# 4. Explaining Subjectivity and Qualia in EPET

A central task for any consciousness theory is explaining **qualia**, the subjective quality of experience [@tyeQualia2021]. How do brain processes generate the "what is it like?" [@nagelWhatItLikeBat1980]? This 'hard problem' [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995] challenges integration of consciousness into science.

EPET offers a scientific-philosophical explanation of phenomenal experience's structure, characteristics, and realization within emergentist ontology. It reframes the 'hard problem', providing a **mechanistic explanation** of how **integrated predictive modeling in an embodied system** inherently **realizes** subjectivity and qualia.


## 4.1. EPET’s Core Hypothesis: Qualia as Properties of the Predictive Modeling Process

EPET’s core hypothesis is that **qualia are constituted by—or are identical to—specific intrinsic characteristics (properties, aspects, dimensions) of the dynamic, integrated, embodied predictive modeling process itself.** This constitution occurs when the process meets sufficient conditions, including adequate complexity, stability over minimal durations, global availability via mechanisms like GWT, and encoding system-evaluated relevance pertinent to the organism's goals or homeostasis. Qualia are not separate non-physical additions but are what this specific emergent process is like from the system's perspective.

Key aspects include:
1.  **“What-it’s-likeness” as Intrinsic to Modeling:** A quale’s specific quality (e.g., “redness”) *is* the particular way the predictive system models an interaction type and its **significance** (for survival, goals) within its global, embodied model [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. Affective valence, for instance, is how the system intrinsically represents the relevance of internal/external states.
2.  **Dependence on Specific Process Organization:** These qualitative properties arise only given a specific organization and dynamics, including: hierarchical PP, recurrence [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], GWT-mediated integration [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], embodiment [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991], active inference [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010], and relevance evaluation mechanisms [@damasioDescartesError2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].


## 4.2. Specifying the “Properties of the Process”

To avoid mere redescription, EPET specifies the "properties of the process" hypothesized to constitute qualia:

1.  **Multidimensional State Space:** Predictive modeling unfolds as a trajectory within the system’s complex neural state space [@churchlandNeurophilosophyUnifiedScience1989].
2.  **Dimensions and Phenomenal Characteristics:** Key dimensions of phenomenal experience are hypothesized to correspond to specific characteristics of this predictive modeling process, as summarized in Table 1.

    <!-- Pandoc Table -->
    | Phenomenal Dimension | Corresponding Process Characteristic(s) in EPET | Key References |
    | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
    | **Specificity/Quality** (e.g., "red" vs "blue") | Specific pattern/region in state space occupied by the predictive model (learned via statistics). | |
    | **Intensity/Clarity** (e.g., vividness) | Dynamic properties: stability, signal strength (rate/synchrony), assigned **precision**. | [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013] |
    | **Affective Valence** (pleasant/unpleasant) | Ongoing evaluation of **interoceptive prediction errors** relative to goals. Valence *is* the phenomenal character. | [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017] |

    **Table 1:** Proposed correspondence between phenomenal dimensions and characteristics of the predictive modeling process in EPET.
3.  **Analogy with Emergent Macro-Properties:** Like "temperature" or "fluidity," qualia are real macroscopic properties arising from neural modeling organization and dynamics [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999], requiring no extra "essence."
4.  **Why This Specific Process?:** The unique combination of features—a unified world model relative to an embodied, egocentric self, aimed at flexible control, linked to relevance evaluation, including self-modeling, with results integrated and globally available—constitutes a process that, when experienced from within, *is* subjective experience.


## 4.3. Subjectivity and the “First-Person Perspective”

Experience's subjectivity arises not from a separate observer, but from the **modeling system's inherent perspective**. The model is constructed egocentrically (relative to the agent's body/state), embodiedly (based on unique sensory/interoceptive signals), and goal-orientedly (in context of the agent's needs/history). The "first-person perspective" *is* this active, embodied, goal-oriented modeling system’s perspective [@metzingerBeingNoOne2004; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].


##  4.4. Strategy for Addressing the 'hard problem'

The 'hard problem' of consciousness [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995] – the question of why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience or qualia – remains a central challenge for any physicalist theory. EPET confronts this challenge not by claiming to definitively "solve" the mystery in a way that would satisfy all philosophical intuitions, but by offering a coherent and scientifically grounded framework for understanding how phenomenal characteristics are realized within an emergentist physicalist ontology. This involves addressing not only the 'hard problem' itself but also the "meta-problem of consciousness" – the problem of explaining why we think consciousness poses such a 'hard problem' [@chalmers2020meta]. EPET's strategy involves several key components:

### 4.4.1. Reframing the Question: From Generation to Realization

EPET begins by reframing the core question. Instead of asking, “Why does physical process P give rise to or generate phenomenal characteristic Q (as something separate or additional)?”, EPET asks, **“What specific organizational and dynamic properties of emergent physical process P (identified here as integrated, embodied predictive modeling) realize or constitute phenomenal characteristics Q?”** This shift moves the focus from an often-mysterious notion of "generation" to a scientific-philosophical investigation of **realization** or **constitution** within a unified physicalist framework; a strategy central to EPET's **constitutive explanation of qualia** (detailed in Section 4.4.2). This reframing also helps in approaching the "meta-problem of consciousness" [@chalmers2020meta] – the problem of explaining why we think consciousness poses such a 'hard problem'. By focusing on how specific physical processes realize phenomenal characteristics, we can better understand how our cognitive and conceptual apparatus (see Section 4.4.4) might lead to the intuition of an unbridgeable gap, even if no such ontological gap exists.

### 4.4.2. The Constitutive Explanation of Qualia: An Emergentist-Physicalist Identity

The cornerstone of EPET’s approach to the 'hard problem' is a **constitutive explanation of qualia, grounded in emergentist physicalism.** EPET posits a form of **identity**: qualia **are** specific, high-level organizational and dynamic properties of the integrated, embodied predictive modeling process itself, when this process reaches sufficient complexity, stability, global availability, and system-evaluated relevance (as detailed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2).

-   **Identity, Not Causation:** This is not a claim that process P causes qualia Q as a separate effect. Instead, it is an identity claim: to be this specific kind of complex, integrated, embodied predictive process is to be or to instantiate the phenomenal experience Q. The subjective "what-it's-likeness" is the intrinsic aspect of this particular kind of organized dynamic process unfolding. This aligns with contemporary approaches viewing qualia as intrinsic features of certain neural computations, such as Safron's proposal that phenomenal consciousness is "what it is like to be the functioning of a probabilistic generative model" [@safron2020implemented], Harris's view of qualia as dynamic "query acts" within predictive coding [@harrisQualiaQueryAct2025], or Gong's characterization of conscious experience as the brain's best predictive hypothesis made explicit at a global level [@gongComputationalExplanationConsciousness2024].
    
-   **Epistemic Perspectives:** The apparent gap between an objective, third-person description of neural activity (the 'process P') and a subjective, first-person experience (the 'quale Q') can then be understood as arising from two distinct **epistemic perspectives** on the same underlying emergent phenomenon. The objective perspective describes the structure and dynamics of the process, while the subjective perspective is the process unfolding as experienced by the system itself. The challenge of bridging these perspectives is thus seen not as an ontological chasm, but as an epistemic one, related to the different ways we access and conceptualize the same reality (see Section 4.4.4).
    

### 4.4.3. The “Nothing Extra” Argument within Emergentist Physicalism

EPET’s constitutive view is grounded in a consistent **emergentist physicalism** and a "nothing extra" argument:

-   **Weak Emergence and Constitutive Identity:** EPET views consciousness as a case of **"standard ('weak') emergence"** [@feinberg2020phenomenal]. This means phenomenal properties, while novel at the system level, do not require new fundamental forces or substances. They are wholly dependent on, and realized by, the organization and dynamics of their physical constituents. As argued by Feinberg & Mallatt (2020) [@feinberg2020phenomenal], this form of emergence does not entail a "scientific explanatory gap," only an "experiential or epistemic gap" which is "ontologically untroubling." The unique qualities of subjective experience are thus attributable to the **unique and highly specific organization and dynamics** of the predictive modeling process. Crucially, weak emergence provides the metaphysical framework for understanding how qualia can be **constitutively identical** to specific complex physical processes: the phenomenal properties are the novel, system-level characteristics that manifest when the physical constituents are organized in a particular dynamic way. They are 'nothing over and above' the physical base in terms of substance or fundamental forces, yet they represent a genuine level of reality with its own descriptive and explanatory purchase. This aligns with rigorous frameworks of metaphysical emergence [@wilson2021metaphysical], which detail how higher-level properties can be novel and possess distinct causal profiles (e.g., by having a proper subset of the causal powers of their physical base) while remaining fully physically grounded.
    
-   **The "Nothing Extra" Principle:** Just as biology no longer seeks an extra ‘élan vital’ to explain life, consciousness science, within an emergentist physicalist framework, need not demand an extra non-physical ‘phenomenal essence’ beyond the specific, complex dynamics realizing the functional and relational properties of experience. The intuition that something 'extra' is needed often stems from a presupposition that qualia must be simple, monadic properties, divorced from the complexity of the underlying process. EPET, by contrast, suggests that the richness and specificity of qualia are reflections of the richness and specificity of the integrated predictive modeling process itself. Thus, the search for an 'extra' ingredient becomes unnecessary once the phenomenal is understood as the intrinsic nature of this specific kind of organized complexity.
    
-   **Qualia as Real, Emergent, and Causally Relevant Properties:** Critically, EPET affirms the **reality of phenomenal experience and qualia**. They are not illusions to be explained away (contra strong illusionism, e.g., [@carruthersStopCaringConsciousness2020]). Instead, EPET identifies qualia with specific, real, and **causally relevant** properties of the emergent predictive process itself. As high-level organizational patterns, these conscious states can exert distinct causal influences on the system's behavior, understood within frameworks like interventionism (see Section 7.5 and sources such as [@oconnorEmergentProperties2021; @Negro2022; @Cea2021]).

    

### 4.4.4. Deconstructing the "Explanatory Gap": Category Mistakes and Phenomenal Concepts

If EPET's constitutive explanation within emergentist physicalism holds (4.4.2), and there is 'nothing extra' to phenomenal experience beyond the specific complex process (4.4.3), why does the intuition of an 'explanatory gap' [@levineMaterialismQualiaExplanatory1983] persist so strongly? EPET suggests this persistence stems largely from conceptual confusions or implicit non-physicalist assumptions, factors central to the 'meta-problem of consciousness' [@chalmers2020meta].

-   **Category Mistake:** Expecting a causal explanation for what EPET proposes as a constitutive identity is a category mistake; one does not ask how H₂O molecules cause fluidity, but rather how their dynamic organization constitutes fluidity.
    
-   **Implicit Dualism:** The intuition of a gap is often fueled by an implicit assumption that qualia must be something 'over and above' the physical process, a premise that EPET’s emergentist physicalism explicitly rejects.
    
-   **The Role of Phenomenal Concepts:** The **Phenomenal Concept Strategy (PCS)** offers a powerful way to understand this epistemic divergence. PCS suggests that our special 'phenomenal concepts' for experiences (e.g., the concept of 'what this reddish experience is like') are cognitively distinct from our third-person, theoretical concepts of brain states [@balog2020disillusioned; @Diaz-Leon2020-DIATMO-2]. Phenomenal concepts might be indexical, demonstrative, or based on direct acquaintance from a first-person perspective, and they typically do not carry information about the underlying physical realization of the experience. This conceptual distinctness creates an epistemic gap – it feels like we are talking about two different kinds of things – even if, ontologically, the phenomenal state is a physical brain state. This helps explain the 'problem intuitions' of the meta-problem [@chalmers2020meta] without resorting to dualism.
    

By proposing a constitutive explanation of qualia (4.4.2) realized through weak emergence (4.4.3), and by highlighting these epistemic factors rooted in our conceptual scheme (4.4.4), EPET aims to **make the 'hard problem' more tractable**. It seeks to show that many of the 'problem intuitions' that fuel the sense of an unbridgeable gap can be understood as arising from these conceptual and epistemic features, rather than from an underlying ontological duality. This perspective also offers a way to address classic thought experiments like the Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room) and the Zombie Argument within a physicalist framework (see Supplementary Materials D for discussion).


**4.4.5. Avoiding Panpsychism and Dualism**

This overall explanatory strategy—grounding qualia in emergent physical processes (4.4.2, 4.4.3) and addressing the explanatory gap via epistemic factors (4.4.4)—allows EPET to avoid less parsimonious or scientifically intractable metaphysical positions:

-   **Against Panpsychism:** Qualitative properties, in EPET, arise only with highly complex organization and dynamics, not as intrinsic features of fundamental matter ([@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006]; [@goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017]). This emergentist stance sidesteps the notorious **combination problem** faced by panpsychism (i.e., how myriad micro-consciousnesses could combine to form macro-conscious experience) and aligns better with the current lack of empirical evidence for consciousness in simple physical systems. Furthermore, EPET's focus on specific organizational prerequisites for consciousness maintains empirical testability, unlike many panpsychist claims which are often criticized for their unfalsifiability ([@gaetanolicataPanpsychismEmergentismMindbody2024]; [@yurchenko2024panpsychism]).
    
-   **Against Dualism:** By identifying qualia as intrinsic properties of a physical (albeit emergent) process, EPET remains firmly within a physicalist ontology. This explicitly rejects substance dualism (which posits a non-physical mental substance) and strong property dualism (which posits ontologically independent non-physical properties). In EPET, emergent phenomenal properties are novel and qualitatively distinct, but they are fully dependent on, and realized by, the underlying physical organization and dynamics of the brain-body system.

    

### 4.4.6. The Scope and Limits of EPET's Explanation

EPET aims to provide a **coherent, plausible, and heuristically valuable framework** for understanding how consciousness is realized in physical systems. By identifying qualia with intrinsic properties of an integrated, embodied predictive modeling process (4.4.2), by grounding this in weak emergence (4.4.3), and by addressing the epistemic nature of the explanatory gap (4.4.4), EPET offers a naturalistic explanation for the structure, function, and characteristics of conscious experience, including many of the 'problem intuitions' associated with the meta-problem [@chalmers2020meta].

However, EPET does not claim to eliminate the fundamental **intuitive wonder** that any physical organization should be accompanied by subjective experience. This residual sense of wonder, perhaps stemming from the inherent limitations of our third-person conceptual tools to fully capture first-person reality, or from the sheer complexity of the phenomenon, may persist even with a complete naturalistic account of realization. The question "why is there subjective experience at all?" may touch upon levels of explanation that lie beyond the scope of current scientific or philosophical frameworks.

EPET's contribution lies in demonstrating that, given subjective experience as a natural phenomenon, its realization can be understood naturalistically through specific organizational and dynamic principles. This approach not only makes the 'hard problem' of how qualia are realized more tractable but also sheds light on the 'meta-problem' by explaining why we find consciousness so perplexing, even if a fundamental sense of wonder at its mere existence remains. The theory shows how physical systems can realize phenomenology through complex organization, thereby advancing our understanding, even if a complete dissolution of all mystery is not achieved.


## 4.5. Section Conclusion  

EPET offers a naturalistic, non-reductive explanation of subjectivity/qualia as intrinsic properties of the emergent process of integrated predictive modeling. It aims to address the 'hard problem' by explaining qualia's characteristics within a scientific worldview compatible with dependent origination, without denying phenomenal reality.
