# 4. Explaining Subjectivity and Qualia in EPET

One of the central tasks of any theory of consciousness is to explain its most enigmatic aspect – the subjective, qualitative character of experience, or **qualia** [see review in @tyeQualia2021]. How and why do physical processes in the brain generate the inner feeling of "what is it like?" [@nagelPhilosophicalReview1974] to see red, feel pain, or hear music? This "hard problem of consciousness" [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995] challenges the very possibility of fully integrating consciousness into the scientific worldview.

EPET does not aim to metaphysically "derive" subjectivity from objectivity through simple logical or nomological entailment. Instead, EPET offers a **scientific-philosophical explanation of the structure, characteristics, and realization mechanisms** of phenomenal experience within a naturalistic (emergentist) ontology. To achieve this, EPET reframes the traditional question of the "hard problem" and provides a **mechanistic explanation** of how the specific emergent process described in the previous section – **integrated predictive modeling in an embodied system** – inherently **realizes** those characteristics that we intuitively grasp with the concepts of "subjectivity" and "qualia."

## 4.1. EPET's Core Hypothesis: Qualia as Properties of the Predictive Modeling Process

EPET's central hypothesis regarding qualia is as follows:

**Qualia are intrinsic, inherent characteristics (properties, aspects, dimensions) of the dynamic, integrated, embodied process of predictive modeling itself, when this process reaches a certain level of complexity, stability, global availability, and, critically, is evaluated by the system as relevant.**

Qualia are not separate "things" or non-physical "add-ons" to neural activity. They are *what* this specific process *is like* at its emergent level. This position asserts that it is precisely this **unique complex dynamic organization** (see section 4.2.4 below) that emergentism views as the basis for the emergence of high-level properties, such as conscious experience.

Key aspects of this hypothesis:

1.  **"What-it's-likeness" as the System's Way of Modeling:** The specific quality of each quale (e.g., the "redness" of red, the "painfulness" of pain) is the **particular way the predictive system (brain-body) models a certain type of interaction** (with the environment or its own internal state) **and its significance for itself** (for survival, homeostasis, goal achievement) within its global, embodied model of the world and self [see @hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. It is not merely a passive representation of an external property, but an active modeling of that property *in the context of its relevance to the agent*. Qualia are how the system represents certain states and their meaning from a first-person perspective, i.e., from within its own modeling activity.
2.  **Dependence on the Specific Organization of the Process:** The qualitative properties of the process are not universal. They arise only with the **very specific organization and dynamics** characteristic of complex biological nervous systems (or systems with analogous architecture): hierarchical structure (PP), recurrent processing [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], high degree of integration (GWT) [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], embodiment (connection to body and action) [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991], active inference [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010], and, crucially, built-in mechanisms for **evaluating the relevance** of information [@damasioDescartesError2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].

## 4.2. Specifying the "Properties of the Process"

To avoid accusations of mere redescription or reductionism, it is necessary to specify what is meant by the "properties of the process" that constitute qualia:

1.  **Multidimensional State Space:** The process of predictive modeling can be visualized as a trajectory within the extremely complex, multidimensional state space of the neural system [see discussion of neural state spaces, e.g., in @churchlandNeurophilosophyUnifiedScience1989].
2.  **Dimensions of the Space and Phenomenal Characteristics:** Different aspects of phenomenal experience correspond to different characteristics of this process and its trajectory:
    *   **Specificity/Quality:** The quality of phenomenal experience is realized as the **specific pattern or region** in the multidimensional state space that the system occupies when modeling a particular type of interaction. The pattern corresponding to "red" occupies a different region in this space than the pattern for "blue" or the "taste of chocolate." These patterns are formed during development and learning, reflecting the statistical structure of the agent's interactions with the world. This is the realization of the ***Saññā-khandha*** (recognition/classification) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000] as an intrinsic aspect of the modeling process.
    *   **Intensity/Clarity:** The intensity or clarity of qualia is constituted by the **dynamic characteristics** of the process: its **stability** over time, the **strength** of the neural signal (e.g., firing rate or level of synchronization), and the level of assigned **precision** to the corresponding predictions or errors [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. A more stable, strong, and precise modeling process constitutes a more intense or clear quale.
    *   **Affective Valence:** The valence of experience is realized as specific dimensions of the state space related to **interoceptive prediction** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017] and the evaluation of the **homeostatic/allostatic relevance** of the modeled state for the organism [@damasioDescartesError2006; @craigHowYouFeel2009]. The very process of the system modeling a predicted threat to homeostasis or a discrepancy from a target state (high-precision interoceptive prediction errors) *is* what **negative valence (*Vedanā dukkha*)** feels like. Similarly, the process of modeling a predicted restoration/maintenance of homeostasis or progress towards a goal *is* what **positive valence (*Vedanā sukha*)** feels like. Valence is not an "added" feeling, but an intrinsic aspect of the process of modeling relevance itself (the realization of the ***Vedanā-khandha*** [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000]).
3.  **Analogy with Emergent Macro-Properties:** Just as "temperature" is a real macroscopic property of a gas (average kinetic energy) arising from the dynamics of molecules, or the "fluidity" of water arises from the interactions of H₂O molecules, qualia (e.g., "redness") in EPET are understood as **real macroscopic properties** arising from the specific **organization and dynamics** of the neural modeling process [see @kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @mitchellComplexityGuidedTour2009]. We do not require a special "essence of fluidity" over and above the physical processes, and similarly, EPET does not posit an "essence of redness" over and above the specific process.
4.  **Why This Specific Process?:** The process of integrated predictive modeling is unique due to its **complex dynamic organization**. It is aimed at constructing a **unified, coherent model of the world *relative to the self*** for **flexible interaction control**, it is **embodied and egocentric**, inextricably linked to the **evaluation of relevance** for survival and goals, includes **self-modeling**, and its results are **integrated and become globally available**. It is this unique combination of characteristics that constitutes a process which feels from the inside like subjective experience.

## 4.3. Subjectivity and the "First-Person Perspective"

The subjectivity of experience, its belonging to a "first-person perspective," is explained in EPET not by the presence of a separate observer-subject, but by the **inherent perspective of the modeling system itself**. The model is inherently constructed:

*   **Egocentrically:** Relative to the position and state of the agent's body.
*   **Embodiedly:** Based on the unique sensory and interoceptive signals of *this particular* body.
*   **Goal-orientedly:** In the context of the needs, goals, and history of *this particular* agent.

The "first-person perspective" *is* the perspective of this active, embodied, modeling system for which the model is generated [see @metzingerBeingNoOne2004; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].

## 4.4. Strategy for Addressing the "Hard Problem"

EPET proposes the following strategy for addressing the "hard problem":

1.  **Reframing the Question:** The traditional question "Why does physical process P give rise to quale Q?" might be ill-posed within emergentist physicalism. If quale Q is an emergent property/process arising from the specific organization of process P, then the question shifts from a metaphysical "why" (in the sense of generation ex nihilo) to a scientific-philosophical "how." EPET asks: "**What are the specific properties of the emergent physical process P (in terms of integrated predictive modeling) that *realize* or *constitute* the phenomenal characteristics we call quale Q?**"
2.  **Mechanistic Explanation:** EPET provides a detailed **mechanistic explanation** (Section 4.2) of how different aspects of the process (predictions, errors, precision, interoception, integration, self-modeling) correspond to and realize different aspects of phenomenal experience (specificity, intensity, valence, subjectivity, unity, sense of self).
3.  **The "Nothing Extra" Argument:** EPET's key thesis is that if we have given a complete description of this complex, dynamic, integrated, embodied, relevance-oriented, self-modeling process at its own emergent level, then **we have already described everything there is to conscious experience**. The "what-it's-likeness" is not an additional, mysterious entity. **The "what-it's-likeness" *is* what this process is like from the inside, from the system's own perspective, at its emergent level.** The intuition of an "explanatory gap" may stem from a category mistake or implicit dualism [see critique in @dennettQuiningQualia1988]. If we accept emergentist physicalism and view consciousness as a real emergent process, there is no reason to expect anything beyond this specific process itself, just as we do not expect a "life force" (*élan vital*) over and above complex biochemical processes or an "essence of fluidity" over and above molecular interactions. EPET explains all the functional, relational, and dynamic aspects we associate with qualia, arguing that these aspects, realized by the specific process, *are* the qualia.

## 4.5. Avoiding Panpsychism and Dualism

The proposed explanation of qualia as properties of a specific emergent process allows EPET to avoid undesirable metaphysical positions:

*   **Against Panpsychism:** Qualitative properties arise only with **highly complex organization and specific dynamics** (integrated predictive modeling), and are not inherent to matter as such [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017]. This aligns with ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** (dependence on complex conditions).
*   **Against Dualism:** Qualia are understood as **properties of the physical (emergent) process itself**, fully determined by it and incapable of existing separately.

## 4.6. Section Conclusion

EPET offers a naturalistic yet non-reductive explanation of subjectivity and qualia. By viewing them not as a mysterious "add-on" to the physical world, but as intrinsic properties of the specific, emergent process of integrated predictive modeling realized by embodied agents, EPET aims to overcome the "hard problem." This approach allows explaining the key characteristics of subjective experience – its specificity, intensity, valence, and first-person perspective – within a scientific worldview compatible with the principles of dependent origination and without requiring the denial of the reality of phenomenal consciousness. While the ultimate metaphysical mystery of the origin of subjectivity itself may remain unresolved, EPET offers the most complete and coherent naturalistic framework for explaining the structure, functions, and characteristics of conscious experience available within contemporary science and emergentist philosophy.
