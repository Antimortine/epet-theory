# 4. Explaining Subjectivity and Qualia in EPET

A central task for any consciousness theory is explaining **qualia**, the subjective quality of experience [@tyeQualia2021]. How do brain processes generate the "what is it like?" [@nagelPhilosophicalReview1974]? This "hard problem" [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995] challenges integration of consciousness into science.

EPET offers a scientific-philosophical explanation of phenomenal experience's structure, characteristics, and realization within emergentist ontology. It reframes the hard problem, providing a **mechanistic explanation** of how **integrated predictive modeling in an embodied system** inherently **realizes** subjectivity and qualia.

## 4.1. EPET's Core Hypothesis: Qualia as Properties of the Predictive Modeling Process

EPET's hypothesis on qualia:

**Qualia are intrinsic characteristics (properties, aspects, dimensions) of the dynamic, integrated, embodied predictive modeling process itself, when this process reaches sufficient complexity, stability, global availability, and system-evaluated relevance.**

Qualia are not separate entities or non-physical additions. They are what this specific emergent process is like. This unique complex dynamic organization is the basis for emergent high-level properties like conscious experience.

Key aspects:

1.  **"What-it's-likeness" as Modeling:** A quale's specific quality (e.g., "redness") is the **particular way the predictive system models an interaction type and its significance** (for survival, goals) within its global, embodied model [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. It's active modeling of a property in context of its relevance to the agent. Qualia are how the system represents states and meaning from its first-person modeling perspective.
    
2.  **Dependence on Process Organization:** Qualitative properties arise only with **specific organization and dynamics**: hierarchical structure (PP), recurrence [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], integration (GWT) [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], embodiment [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991], active inference [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010], and **relevance evaluation** mechanisms [@damasioDescartesError2006; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].
    

## 4.2. Specifying the "Properties of the Process"

To avoid mere redescription, "properties of the process" constituting qualia are specified:

1.  **Multidimensional State Space:** Predictive modeling is a trajectory within the system's complex, multidimensional neural state space [@churchlandNeurophilosophyUnifiedScience1989].
    
2.  **Dimensions and Phenomenal Characteristics:** Aspects of experience correspond to characteristics of this process/trajectory:
    
    -   **Specificity/Quality:** Realized as the **specific pattern/region** in state space occupied when modeling a particular interaction type. "Red" occupies a different region than "blue." Patterns form via learning, reflecting interaction statistics. Realizes **Saññā-khandha** (recognition) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
        
    -   **Intensity/Clarity:** Constituted by **dynamic characteristics**: **stability**, **signal strength** (firing rate/synchronization), and assigned **precision** [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. A more stable, strong, precise process constitutes a more intense/clear quale.
        
    -   **Affective Valence:** Realized as state space dimensions related to **interoceptive prediction** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017] and **homeostatic/allostatic relevance** evaluation [@damasioDescartesError2006; @craigHowYouFeel2009]. Modeling predicted homeostatic threats (high-precision errors) is  **negative valence (Vedanā dukkha)**. Modeling predicted homeostatic restoration/goal progress is  **positive valence (Vedanā sukha)**. Valence is intrinsic to modeling relevance (realizing **Vedanā-khandha** [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000]).
        
3.  **Analogy with Emergent Macro-Properties:** Like "temperature" arises from molecular dynamics or "fluidity" from H₂O interactions, qualia ("redness") are **real macroscopic properties** arising from neural modeling **organization and dynamics** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @mitchellComplexityGuidedTour2009]. No extra "essence" is needed beyond the process.
    
4.  **Why This Specific Process?:** Integrated predictive modeling is unique: aimed at a **unified world model relative to self** for **flexible control**, **embodied and egocentric**, linked to **relevance evaluation**, includes **self-modeling**, results are **integrated and globally available**. This combination constitutes a process felt from inside as subjective experience.
    

## 4.3. Subjectivity and the "First-Person Perspective"

Experience's subjectivity arises not from a separate observer, but the **modeling system's inherent perspective**. The model is constructed:

-   **Egocentrically:** Relative to the agent's body position/state.
    
-   **Embodiedly:** Based on this body's unique sensory/interoceptive signals.
    
-   **Goal-orientedly:** In context of this agent's needs, goals, history.
    

The "first-person perspective" is this active, embodied, modeling system's perspective [@metzingerBeingNoOne2004; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].

## 4.4. Strategy for Addressing the "Hard Problem"

EPET's strategy:

1.  **Reframing the Question:** Instead of "Why P gives rise to Q?", ask: "**What specific properties of emergent process P (integrated predictive modeling) realize or constitute phenomenal characteristics Q?**" This shifts from metaphysical generation to scientific-philosophical realization within emergentist physicalism.
    
2.  **Mechanistic Explanation:** EPET provides a **mechanistic explanation** (Section 4.2) linking process aspects (predictions, errors, precision, interoception, integration, self-modeling) to phenomenal aspects (specificity, intensity, valence, subjectivity, etc.).
    
3.  **The "Nothing Extra" Argument:** A complete description of this complex, dynamic, integrated, embodied, relevance-oriented, self-modeling process at its emergent level **already describes conscious experience**. "What-it's-likeness" isn't an extra entity; it is what this process is like from the inside. The intuition of an "explanatory gap" might stem from category mistakes or implicit dualism [@dennettQuiningQualia1988]. Within emergentist physicalism, expect nothing beyond the specific process, just as no élan vital is expected beyond biochemistry. EPET explains qualia's functional, relational, dynamic aspects, arguing these realized aspects are the qualia. Just as demanding an extra 'essence of life' beyond complex biochemistry became scientifically obsolete, demanding an extra 'phenomenal essence' beyond the specific complex dynamics realizing the functional and relational properties of experience might be similarly misplaced within a consistent physicalist emergentism.
    

## 4.5. Avoiding Panpsychism and Dualism

This explanation avoids undesirable metaphysics:

-   **Against Panpsychism:** Qualitative properties arise only with **highly complex organization/dynamics**, not inherent to matter [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017]. Aligns with **Paṭiccasamuppāda**.
    
-   **Against Dualism:** Qualia are **properties of the physical (emergent) process**, fully determined by it, inseparable.
    

## 4.6. Section Conclusion

EPET offers a naturalistic, non-reductive explanation of subjectivity/qualia as intrinsic properties of the emergent process of integrated predictive modeling. It aims to address the "hard problem" by explaining qualia's characteristics within a scientific worldview compatible with dependent origination, without denying phenomenal reality.
