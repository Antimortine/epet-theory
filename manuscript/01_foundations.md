# 1. Foundations of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory

The Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) represents an integrative approach to the problem of consciousness. It does not arise in a vacuum but intentionally builds upon the achievements and concepts from three key areas: modern sciences of the brain and cognition, Western philosophy of mind, and Buddhist philosophy and psychology. This section briefly outlines the main data, theories, and principles from these areas that form the foundation for constructing EPET, as presented in the subsequent chapters.

## 1.1. Scientific Foundations

Contemporary research on consciousness provides rich empirical material and powerful theoretical models:

*   **Physical Basis and NCC:** There is an undeniable link between consciousness and physical processes in the brain. Studies of the Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) have identified key structures and processes associated both with the overall **level** of wakefulness and consciousness (brainstem, thalamus, global neuromodulation) [@parviziConsciousnessBrainstem2001; @plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982] and with the specific **content** of experience (specific activity in thalamocortical networks, including sensory areas, association cortex – particularly the so-called "posterior hot zone" for phenomenality [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017] – and prefrontal-parietal networks for access [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005]).
*   **Key Theoretical Models:** EPET integrates ideas from several influential theories:
    *   **Predictive Processing (PP):** This rapidly developing framework views the brain as a hierarchical "prediction machine," constantly generating models (hypotheses) about the causes of sensory signals and minimizing prediction errors [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. PP provides EPET with the primary mechanism for explaining perception, the formation of conscious content, attention (as precision modulation) [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010], learning, and, crucially, interoception and affective valence [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].
    *   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** This theory explains how information becomes consciously accessible for report and cognitive control through a mechanism of "broadcasting" into a globally available workspace, implemented by widely distributed neural networks [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. GWT provides EPET with a mechanism for explaining information integration, the unity of consciousness, and conscious *access*.
    *   **Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT):** The importance of recurrent (feedback) connections in neural networks for the integration, stabilization, and formation of rich conscious experience is emphasized [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000; @edelmanRememberedPresentBiological1989]. This idea is compatible with both PP and GWT.
*   **Dynamism of Consciousness:** Neuroimaging data (EEG, MEG) show that the brain activity underlying consciousness is highly dynamic, characterized by complex patterns of synchronization and propagation of activity [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999; @varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001]. This supports the view of consciousness as a continuous, changing process.
*   **Embodiment:** There is growing understanding that consciousness is not a purely "brain-bound" phenomenon but arises from brain-body-environment interactions. The role of bodily signals (especially **interoception** – the perception of internal states [@craigHowYouFeel2002; @damasioDescartesError2006]) and **active inference/action** (sensorimotor loops) [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004] is recognized as fundamental for shaping the affective background, the sense of self, and the very character of perceptual experience.
*   **Plasticity and Data from ASCs:** Conscious experience exhibits significant plasticity. The study of **Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs)** induced by psychoactive substances [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014; @nicholsPsychedelics2016], meditation [@lutzAttentionRegulationMonitoring2008; @tangNeuroscienceMindfulnessMeditation2015], or other methods, provides valuable data on the spectrum of possible experience, the flexibility of perception, thought, and the sense of self (including the phenomenon of "ego dissolution" [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016]). These data serve as an important source of information and "targets" for explanation within EPET.

## 1.2. Philosophical Foundations

EPET is constructed in dialogue with Western philosophy of mind, aiming to offer solutions to its key problems:

*   **Central Problems:** The theory directly addresses the "hard problem" – how to explain the subjective quality of experience (**qualia**) [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995], the problem of explaining the **sense of self** without positing a soul, and the problem of **mental causation** (how consciousness can influence behavior) [see discussion in @kimMindPhysicalWorld2000].
*   **Metaphysical Choice: Emergentist Physicalism:** As its ontological basis, EPET adopts **non-reductive (weak/epistemic) emergentist physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; see also @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004; @mitchellComplexityGuidedTour2009]. This means that:
    *   Consciousness is recognized as a **real phenomenon (process)**, not an illusion or something that can be entirely eliminated or reduced to low-level physics.
    *   This process is **emergent** – it arises from the complex organization and specific dynamics of a physical system (brain-body-environment), but is not inherent in its individual components.
    *   It is **fully dependent** on the underlying physical processes (**supervenience**) [@davidson5MentalEvents1980; @kimSupervenienceMindSelected1993], does not violate the laws of physics, and does not require positing an immaterial substance.
    *   However, consciousness possesses its **own properties** (qualia, intentionality) and **causal efficacy** at its own, emergent level of description, which cannot be fully replaced by a description at the level of neurons without loss of meaning (epistemic irreducibility).
    *   This position rejects substance dualism and panpsychism, as well as radical reductionism/eliminativism.
*   **Key Concepts:** EPET utilizes standard philosophical concepts such as **phenomenal consciousness** (subjective quality) [@blockConfusionFunctionConsciousness1995], **access consciousness** (availability for control and report) [@blockConfusionFunctionConsciousness1995], **qualia** [see review in @tyeQualia2021], **intentionality** [@searleIntentionalityEssayPhilosophy1983; @brentanoPsychologyEmpiricalStandpoint2012], and **representation** (in the sense of a predictive model), giving them specific meaning within the theory.

## 1.3. Buddhist Foundations

EPET draws upon the philosophical and psychological heritage of Buddhism not as a religious doctrine, but as a source of profound insights into the nature of mind and experience, gained through centuries of introspective analysis and conceptual reflection. The following key concepts are used, interpreted in a contemporary context:

*   **No-Self (*Anattā*):** The fundamental doctrine of the **absence of an unchanging, independent, substantial self** or soul [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @collinsSelflessPersonsImagery1982]. In EPET, this principle serves as a crucial constraint and guide for the theory's development.
*   **Impermanence (*Anicca*):** The principle according to which all conditioned phenomena (including mind and consciousness) are in a state of **continuous change, arising, and ceasing** [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012]. This supports the processual view of consciousness in EPET.
*   **Dependent Origination (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*):** The law describing the **interdependent arising** of all phenomena based on conditions [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980]. Consciousness arises not by itself, but dependent on other factors. This principle finds a direct correspondence in EPET's emergentist stance.
*   **Analysis of Experience (Aggregates / *Khandhas*):** Buddhist psychology offers a model for deconstructing experience into five groups of interconnected processes (the **Five Aggregates**): form/materiality (*Rūpa*), feeling/valence (*Vedanā*), perception/recognition (*Saññā*), mental formations/fabrications (*Saṅkhāra*), and consciousness/cognizance (*Viññāṇa*) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000; @gethinFoundationsBuddhism1998]. EPET finds this model heuristically valuable, particularly emphasizing the fundamental role of ***Vedanā*** (affective valence) and ***Saṅkhāra*** (active constructive processes, including the formation of the sense of self) in the structure of conscious experience.

## 1.4. Conclusion: An Integrative Foundation

Thus, EPET is built on a foundation that integrates three perspectives. It uses **scientific mechanisms** (PP, GWT, Embodiment) to explain *how* consciousness might be realized in a physical system. It adopts an **emergentist philosophy** to define the ontological status of consciousness and its properties. And it utilizes the **conceptual tools and phenomenological insights of Buddhism** to guide theoretical construction, especially regarding the nature of the self, impermanence, and the structure of experience. It is upon this integrative foundation that the main tenets of EPET will be erected in the following sections.
