# 1. Foundations of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory

EPET is an integrative approach to consciousness, intentionally building upon achievements and concepts from three key areas: modern sciences of the brain and cognition, Western philosophy of mind, and Buddhist philosophy and psychology. This section briefly outlines these foundational pillars.

## 1.1. Scientific Foundations

Contemporary scientific research provides essential empirical data and powerful theoretical models for understanding consciousness:

*   **Physical Basis and NCC:** Consciousness is undeniably linked to physical brain processes. Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) research seeks to identify the minimal neural activity jointly sufficient for specific conscious experiences. Studies distinguish correlates for the overall **level** of consciousness (wakefulness, involving brainstem, thalamus, neuromodulation [@parviziConsciousnessBrainstem2001; @plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982]) from correlates of specific conscious **content** (involving dynamic activity within thalamocortical networks, including sensory cortices, the 'posterior hot zone' for phenomenal experience [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017], and prefrontal-parietal networks associated with reportability and access [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005]).
*   **Key Theoretical Models:** EPET integrates insights from several influential theoretical frameworks:
    *   **Predictive Processing (PP):** This rapidly developing framework views the brain as a hierarchical inference engine or 'prediction machine'. It constantly generates top-down predictions about the causes of its sensory inputs at multiple levels, and these predictions are compared with bottom-up sensory signals. The discrepancy (prediction error) is used to update the internal generative model, aiming to minimize error over time [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. PP offers a unifying account of perception, action, learning, attention (as precision weighting [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010]), and critically for EPET, interoception and affective experience [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].
    *   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** This theory proposes that information becomes conscious when it gains access to a 'global workspace', making it available ('broadcasted') to a wide range of non-conscious specialized processors throughout the brain [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993]. The neural version (GNWT) identifies this workspace with a distributed network involving long-range connections, particularly between parietal and prefrontal cortices [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. GWT provides EPET with a plausible mechanism for information integration, subjective unity, and conscious reportability (access).
    *   **Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT):** Highlighting the importance of recurrent (top-down and lateral) connections in the cortex, RPT suggests that sustained recurrent processing is necessary for stabilizing representations and enabling rich, conscious experience, distinguishing it from initial feedforward sweeps [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000; @edelmanRememberedPresentBiological1989]. This emphasis on recurrence is highly compatible with both the hierarchical message-passing in PP and the broadcasting dynamics in GWT.
*   **Dynamism of Consciousness:** Neuroimaging methods like EEG and MEG reveal that brain activity underlying consciousness is highly dynamic, involving complex, transient patterns of neural synchronization and information flow across different frequency bands [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999; @varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001], supporting a view of consciousness as an ongoing, fluctuating process.
*   **Embodiment:** A growing consensus acknowledges that consciousness is not purely 'in the head' but arises from dynamic brain-body-environment interactions. The continuous stream of **interoceptive** signals about the body's internal state shapes our affective landscape and sense of self [@craigHowYouFeel2002; @damasioDescartesError2006]. Furthermore, perception is increasingly seen not as passive reception but as **active inference/action**, involving sensorimotor contingencies and cycles of prediction, action, and sensory updating [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004].
*   **Plasticity and ASCs:** Conscious experience is remarkably plastic. Studying **Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs)**—induced by psychedelics [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014; @nicholsPsychedelics2016], meditation [@lutzAttentionRegulationMonitoring2008; @tangNeuroscienceMindfulnessMeditation2015], or other means—provides crucial insights into the malleability of perception, thought, and self-consciousness, including phenomena like 'ego dissolution' [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016]. ASCs serve as valuable 'natural experiments' for testing theories of consciousness like EPET.

## 1.2. Philosophical Foundations

EPET engages with core issues and concepts in Western philosophy of mind:

*   **Central Problems:** Directly tackles the 'hard problem' of **qualia** [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995], the nature of the **sense of self**, and **mental causation** [@kimMindPhysicalWorld2000].
*   **Metaphysical Choice: Emergentist Physicalism:** Adopts **non-reductive (weak/epistemic) emergentist physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004; @mitchellComplexityGuidedTour2009]. This view holds that consciousness is a real, emergent process arising from complex physical organization, fully dependent on (**supervenient** upon) underlying physics [@davidson5MentalEvents1980; @kimSupervenienceMindSelected1993], yet possessing genuinely novel properties and causal efficacy at its own level, making it epistemically irreducible. It rejects substance dualism, panpsychism, and eliminative/reductive physicalism.
*   **Key Concepts:** Employs standard distinctions like **phenomenal vs. access consciousness** [@blockConfusionFunctionConsciousness1995], and concepts like **qualia** [@tyeQualia2021], **intentionality** [@searleIntentionalityEssayPhilosophy1983; @brentanoPsychologyEmpiricalStandpoint2012], and **representation** (interpreted via predictive models), integrating them within the EPET framework.

## 1.3. Buddhist Foundations

EPET utilizes Buddhist philosophy not in a religious sense, but in a strictly philosophical and methodological one. Historically, the Buddhist tradition offers millennia of systematic phenomenology of consciousness, analogous in rigor to Western phenomenological traditions (e.g., Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) yet perhaps more pragmatically oriented towards the investigation of subjective experience. Concepts such as ***Anattā*** (no-self / absence of an independent 'I'), ***Anicca*** (impermanence), and ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** (dependent origination) are employed by EPET similarly to how ancient Greek philosophical concepts (e.g., 'essence', 'substance') are used in contemporary thought – stripped of their original religious context and utilized as precise philosophical tools.

These particular concepts are uniquely valuable for the philosophy of consciousness as they help EPET avoid common philosophical pitfalls like the substantialization of consciousness, substance dualism, or the implicit 'Cartesian theater'. EPET's engagement with these concepts is motivated not by their cultural origin, but solely by their philosophical clarity, methodological neutrality, and heuristic power for the scientific study of mind. While analogous ideas exist in Western philosophy (e.g., Hume, Nietzsche, James, Parfit, Dennett), the Buddhist tradition arguably provides some of the most detailed and pragmatically applicable conceptual and phenomenological models of consciousness suitable for integration with contemporary cognitive science and neuroscience. Specifically, EPET finds the analysis of experience into the five aggregates (***Pañca Khandhā***: *Rūpa*, *Vedanā*, *Saññā*, *Saṅkhāra*, *Viññāṇa* [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000; @gethinFoundationsBuddhism1998]), particularly the roles of *Vedanā* (valence) and *Saṅkhāra* (constructive processes), heuristically valuable.

## 1.4. Conclusion: An Integrative Foundation

EPET rests on integrating these scientific mechanisms (PP, GWT, Embodiment), philosophical commitments (emergentist physicalism), and Buddhist conceptual tools/insights. This foundation supports the specific theses about consciousness developed in the following sections.
