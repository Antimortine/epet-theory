# 3. Central Theses of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory

Building upon the discussed scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations and the adopted metaphysical position of emergentist physicalism, the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) formulates the following central theses regarding the nature of consciousness, its realization mechanisms, and the explanation of the sense of "self."

## 3.1. Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

The first main thesis of EPET concerns the very nature of consciousness and the mechanisms underlying it:

**1.1. Emergence and Processuality:** Consciousness is neither a fundamental property of matter nor a separate substance. It is an **emergent process** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @oconnorEmergentProperties2021], arising from the specific organization and dynamics of a physical system (brain-body-environment). Like all conditioned phenomena, this process is inherently **dynamic and impermanent (*Anicca*)** [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012], representing a continuous flow of arising and ceasing states, entirely **dependent on conditions (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].

**1.2. Embodiment:** Consciousness is inextricably linked to the **living body (*Rūpa*)** and its **active interaction** with the environment [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @clarkBeingTherePutting1998]. Conscious experience is constituted not only by neural processes in the brain but also by the continuous flow of signals from the body (**interoception** [@craigHowYouFeel2002], **proprioception**) and **sensorimotor loops** (perception as active engagement) [@noeActionPerception2004]. The body is an indispensable foundation and component of conscious experience.

**1.3. Predictive Modeling (PP) as the Core Mechanism:** The primary mechanism generating the content and quality of conscious experience is the **active, hierarchical process of Predictive Processing (PP)** [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. The brain-body functions as a system that constantly **generates multimodal predictions (hypotheses)** about the causes of its sensory signals (external, bodily, internal) at various levels of abstraction. The main goal of this process is to **minimize prediction error** (the discrepancy between predictions and actual signals) in the long run, which is equivalent to building the most accurate and action-guiding model of the world and the self.

**1.4. Content of Consciousness = Content of the Active Predictive Model:** EPET postulates that the **content** of conscious experience at any given moment is determined by the content of the **current, active, coherent predictive model** – that is, the system's "best guess" about the state of the world and itself [see @hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. We perceive not "raw" data, but the output of our internal model.

**1.5. Role of Prediction Errors and Precision (Attention):** **Prediction errors** play a key role in updating predictive models [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010]. Errors to which the system assigns high **precision** – meaning it considers them reliable and relevant – have greater weight in model updates and are more likely to become the content of conscious experience (especially if they concern unexpected or important events). **Attention mechanisms (*Manasikāra*)** in EPET are largely implemented through the **modulation of precision** for specific predictions or prediction errors [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013, Ch. 3].

**1.6. Global Availability (GWT) for Integration and Access:** Although PP generates the content and quality of experience, an additional mechanism is needed to form a **unified, integrated, and consciously accessible** experience. EPET employs the concept of the **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993]: the content of the predictive model (or significant prediction errors) must reach a state of **global availability** across the system, becoming accessible to a wide range of cognitive processes (working memory, language, planning). This mechanism, implemented through widely distributed neural networks (especially prefrontal-parietal ones) [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], ensures the **integration** of various aspects of experience into a unified whole and **stabilizes** the current "conscious scene." Thus, full conscious experience in EPET arises at the intersection of PP (model generation) and GWT (integration and access) processes.

**1.7. Functions of Consciousness:** This complex emergent process (integrated predictive modeling with global availability) is not an epiphenomenon but performs several key **adaptive functions**, including: integrating multisensory information, constructing a coherent picture of the world, enabling flexible and goal-directed behavior in complex environments, facilitating error-based learning, supporting social cognition and metacognitive control, as well as simulating future scenarios and planning [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCognitiveNeuroscienceConsciousness2001].

## 3.2. Thesis 2: Integration and Unity of Experience without a Substantial "Self"

The second main thesis of EPET concerns the explanation of the unity of conscious experience and the nature of the sense of "self":

**2.1. Unity as Functional Integration:** The apparent **unity of conscious experience** (feature binding, cross-modal integration, sense of wholeness) does not require positing a central "self" or "observer." In EPET, unity is an **emergent functional property** of the conscious process itself, achieved through mechanisms of **dynamic information integration** (neural synchronization [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999], recurrent processing [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000]) within the framework of the **globally available predictive model (PP+GWT)**.

**2.2. Absence of a Substantial "Self" (*Anattā*):** In accordance with the principle of ***Anattā***, EPET **rejects the existence** of an unchanging, independent, substantial "self" or soul as a real ontological entity [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @collinsSelflessPersonsImagery1982].

**2.3. "Self" as a Construct of Self-Modeling (PP + *Saṅkhāra*):** The phenomenal **sense of "self"** (the feeling of being a subject of experience, agent of actions, owner of a body and personal history) is explained in EPET as an **emergent, dynamic construct**. It results from a **recursive process of self-modeling**, embedded within the overall architecture of predictive processing [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013, pp. 254-256; @sethBeingYouNew2021; see also @metzingerEgoTunnelScience2010]. The system constructs and constantly updates a **model of itself** as an active, embodied agent interacting with the environment. This self-model includes predictions about the body's boundaries and state (proprioception, interoception), about the authorship and consequences of one's own actions (sense of agency), and about one's own mental states (metacognition). This construction process is a key aspect of what is described in Buddhist psychology as the ***Saṅkhāra-khandha*** (mental formations/fabrications) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**2.4. Plasticity and Dissolution of the "Self":** Since the sense of self is a dynamic construct (a model) rather than an essence, it is **plastic** and subject to change. This is supported by data from neuropsychology (syndromes of impaired self-awareness) and especially from **Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs)**. Phenomena of **"ego dissolution,"** often observed during meditation or under the influence of psychedelics [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @carhart-harrisNeuralCorrelatesPsychedelic2012], are interpreted in EPET as resulting from a temporary disruption of the stability, precision, or coherence of the predictive self-model, serving as empirical evidence for its **constructed and non-substantial (*Anattā*)** nature.

## 3.3. Section Conclusion

Thus, EPET proposes viewing consciousness as a specific type of emergent, embodied process based on mechanisms of integrated predictive modeling (PP+GWT). Subjective experience and its unity are explained by the properties and integration of this process, while the sense of "self" is understood as a dynamic construct of self-modeling arising within the same process. These theses form the core of the theory, and based on them, the next section will offer an explanation for the most challenging aspect of consciousness – subjective quality or qualia.
