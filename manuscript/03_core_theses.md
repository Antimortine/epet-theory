# 3. Central Theses of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory

Grounded in the scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations previously discussed (Sections 1 & 2), particularly its emergentist physicalism, EPET formulates the following central theses regarding the nature of consciousness, its realization mechanisms, and the explanation of the "self."

## 3.1. Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

EPET defines consciousness not as a fundamental substance, but as a **real emergent process** arising from  the specific organization and dynamics of the brain–body–environment system [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999, pp. 31–33; @oconnorEmergentProperties2021, Sec. 5.1]. This process is inherently **dynamic, impermanent, and conditionally arising**, echoing Buddhist ontological principles (impermanence (*Anicca*) and dependent origination (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*); Section 1.3) [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012, pp. 55–62; @bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980, p. 254]. It is inextricably linked to the **living body** and its **active environmental interaction**, constituted by neural processes, continuous bodily signals (**interoception, proprioception**), and **sensorimotor loops** (Section 1.1) [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991, pp. 172–173; @craigHowYouFeel2002, p. 655; @noeActionPerception2004, Ch. 3].

The primary mechanism generating conscious content and quality is **active, hierarchical Predictive Processing (PP)**, which minimizes prediction error to build an action-guiding world/self-model [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. EPET postulates that conscious **content** is the **current, active, coherent predictive model** [@sethBeingYouNew2021]. Prediction errors, weighted by **precision** (i.e., the estimated reliability or inverse variance of a signal, often equated with attention-modulated salience), drive model updates and influence awareness [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010, p. 1].

For this PP-generated information to become consciously accessed, integrated, and stabilized, EPET incorporates **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993]. Selected content (stable predictions or high-precision errors) is globally broadcast. The precise neurodynamic mechanisms of the PP↔GWT interface are actively investigated (see Section 1.1 for conceptual background and Supplementary Materials A.1-A.2 for details). Current hypotheses suggest this interface involves "predictive routing," where top-down predictions (potentially carried by alpha/beta oscillations) modulate the processing of bottom-up sensory information and prediction errors (potentially carried by gamma oscillations). High-priority signals, weighted by precision (attention), then compete for global availability [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010; @bastosLayerRhythmSpecificity2020, p. 31459, 31464; @xiongPropofolmediatedLossConsciousness2024 p. 1]. Thus, in EPET's view, the generation of conscious experience involves a dynamic cycle: the PP hierarchy generates potential contents; these signals, modulated by predictive routing and precision, compete for access to the GWT; successful signals trigger widespread 'ignition' and global broadcast [@mashourConsciousProcessingGlobal2020, p. 777; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014, p. 168; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021, pp. 1–3]; this broadcast allows the selected content to be integrated, stabilized, and made available for report and higher cognition, thereby constituting the conscious state. The precise details of this interface remain an active research area, constituting a key direction for future refinement of EPET and related models.

This complex emergent process serves key adaptive **functions** like information integration, coherent modeling, and flexible behavior [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993, pp. 296–298; @dehaeneCognitiveNeuroscienceConsciousness2001, pp. 3–4].

## 3.2. Thesis 2: Integration, Unity, and a Non-Substantial "Self"

The apparent **unity of conscious experience** is an emergent functional property of dynamic information integration (e.g., neural synchronization, recurrence) within the globally available PP-GWT model, requiring no central "self" [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999, p. 49, 55; @lammeDistinctModesVision2000, pp. 576–578].

Consistent with the Buddhist principle of *Anattā* (no-self) (Section 1.3), EPET rejects a substantial, unchanging self. This principle serves not merely as a parallel but as an active conceptual constraint, guiding EPET to formulate the self-model as necessarily processual and non-reifying, thereby precluding the introduction of any homuncular subject or essential core often implicitly present in less constrained models. The phenomenal **sense of "self"** (subjectivity, agency, ownership) is an **emergent, dynamic construct** arising from recursive **predictive self-modeling** of the body, agency, and mental states—understood not as a discrete module but as a distributed, high-level pattern of predictive activity within the overall neural architecture [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013, pp. 254—256; @sethBeingYouNew2021, Ch. 7—11; @metzingerEgoTunnelScience2010, p. 3–12]. This constructed self-sense (paralleling the Buddhist aggregate of constructive mental formations (*saṅkhāra*)) is plastic, as evidenced by phenomena like **"ego dissolution"** [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016, pp. 1–2]. EPET can thus account for both the stable sense of self in typical experience (via a coherent, continuously updated self-model) and its temporary dissolution or alteration (via changes in the precision or dynamics of self-modeling processes, e.g., during meditation or under psychedelics).

## 3.3. Section Conclusion

EPET views consciousness as an emergent, embodied process realized via integrated predictive modeling (PP+GWT). Subjective experience and unity emerge from this process, while the sense of "self" arises as a dynamic self-modeling construct within it. These core theses ground EPET's explanation of qualia.
