# 3. Central Theses of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory

Grounded in the scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations previously discussed (Sections 1 & 2), particularly its emergentist physicalism, EPET formulates the following central theses regarding the nature of consciousness, its realization mechanisms, and the explanation of the "self."

## 3.1. Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

EPET defines consciousness not as a fundamental substance but as a **real, emergent process** arising from the brain-body-environment system's specific organization and dynamics [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @oconnorEmergentProperties2021]. This process is inherently **dynamic, impermanent, and conditionally arising**, echoing Buddhist ontological principles (Anicca, Paṭiccasamuppāda; Sec 1.3) [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980]. It is inextricably linked to the **living body** and its **active environmental interaction**, constituted by neural processes, continuous bodily signals (**interoception, proprioception**), and **sensorimotor loops** (Sec 1.1) [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @craigHowYouFeel2002; @noeActionPerception2004].

The primary mechanism generating conscious content and quality is **active, hierarchical Predictive Processing (PP)**, which minimizes prediction error to build an action-guiding world/self-model [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. EPET postulates that conscious **content** is the **current, active, coherent predictive model** [@sethBeingYouNew2021]. Prediction errors, weighted by **precision** (attention-modulated salience), drive model updates and influence awareness [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010].

For this PP-generated information to become consciously accessed, integrated, and stabilized, EPET incorporates **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993]. Selected content (stable predictions or high-precision errors) is globally broadcast. The precise neurodynamic mechanisms of the PP↔GWT interface, such as "predictive routing" involving specific oscillatory bands (e.g., alpha/beta for top-down predictions, gamma for bottom-up errors) and large-scale synchronization for "ignition", are actively investigated and detailed in works by [@bastosLayerRhythmSpecificity2020; @xiongPropofolmediatedLossConsciousness2024; @perez-gonzalezAcetylcholineModulatesPrecision2024; @mashourConsciousProcessingGlobal2020; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021] (see Sec 1.1 for conceptual background). Full conscious experience in EPET thus emerges from the interplay of PP (content/quality generation) and GWT (integration/access/stabilization). The precise details of this interface remain an active research area, constituting a key direction for future refinement of EPET and related models.

This complex emergent process serves key adaptive **functions** like information integration, coherent modeling, and flexible behavior [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCognitiveNeuroscienceConsciousness2001].

## 3.2. Thesis 2: Integration, Unity, and a Non-Substantial "Self"

The apparent **unity of conscious experience** is an emergent functional property of dynamic information integration (e.g., neural synchronization, recurrence) within the globally available PP-GWT model, requiring no central "self" [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999; @lammeDistinctModesVision2000].

Consistent with the Buddhist principle of **Anattā (no-self)** (Sec 1.3), EPET rejects a substantial, unchanging self. The phenomenal **sense of "self"** (subjectivity, agency, ownership) is an **emergent, dynamic construct** from recursive **predictive self-modeling** of the body, agency, and mental states [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021; @metzingerEgoTunnelScience2010]. This constructed self-sense (paralleling the Buddhist *saṅkhāra*) is plastic, as evidenced by phenomena like **"ego dissolution"** [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016].

## 3.3. Section Conclusion

EPET views consciousness as an emergent, embodied process realized via integrated predictive modeling (PP+GWT). Subjective experience and unity emerge from this process, while the sense of "self" arises as a dynamic self-modeling construct within it. These core theses ground EPET's explanation of qualia.
