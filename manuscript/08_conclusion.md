# 8. Conclusion: EPET as an Integrative Framework for Understanding Consciousness

This work presented the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), an integrative philosophical theory of consciousness based on non-reductive physicalism. EPET views consciousness as a **real, emergent, dynamic, embodied process** arising from the specific organization and activity of the brain-body-environment system.

Key mechanisms are **Predictive Processing (PP)** (generating content/quality via modeling) and **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** (integration, access). **Qualia** are explained as **intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive modeling process**, reflecting interaction representation and relevance. The **"self"** is interpreted as a **dynamic construct of self-modeling**, aligning with **Anattā (no-self)**, supported by neuroscience/ASC studies.

## Main Achievements and Strengths of EPET:

EPET's strength is its **integrative approach**, synthesizing insights from consciousness science (PP, GWT), Western philosophy (emergentism), and Buddhist philosophy (*Anattā*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*). This yields a **scientifically grounded, non-reductive** explanation avoiding extremes (dualism, panpsychism, illusionism), offering a **coherent account** of experience's content, quality, and self-sense, with significant **heuristic value**.

## Acknowledgment of Limitations and Open Questions:

EPET, like any current theory, has limitations: the "hard problem" response remains debatable; mechanistic details (PP-GWT interaction, valence generation) need refinement; more empirical testing is required; the full spectrum of phenomena might not be covered; Buddhist concept interpretations can be discussed.

## Directions for Future Research:

Future work includes: **Theoretical** (refining models, integrating with emotion/social cognition, exploring meditation links, formal/computational modeling) and **Empirical** (new paradigms for testing correlates of prediction/error/precision/valence, neurostimulation, ASC studies).

## Testable Hypotheses of EPET

EPET generates specific, potentially falsifiable hypotheses:

**Prediction 1: Dissociation between qualia intensity and access via precision manipulation.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Qualia intensity depends on PP stability/precision; Access depends on GWT availability.
*   **Prediction:** EPET generates the empirically testable prediction that manipulating precision weighting (e.g., confidence in sensory signals via priming or statistics) in near-threshold perception tasks will primarily affect subjective qualia vividness ratings, while manipulations of global workspace availability (e.g., task relevance or report instructions) will primarily influence conscious access and reportability (indexed by neural markers such as the P3b component), with minimal impact on vividness itself.
*   **Falsification:** If, contrary to EPET’s prediction, precision manipulation directly affects reportability and global markers (e.g., P3b) independently from qualia intensity, or if access manipulations strongly affect vividness, the theory's proposed division of labor would need revision.

**Prediction 2: Affective valence reflects interoceptive prediction error minimization.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Affective valence (*Vedanā*) reflects the organism's ongoing success or failure in minimizing interoceptive prediction errors relative to homeostatic/allostatic set-points.
*   **Prediction:** EPET hypothesizes that subjective affective valence ratings should closely correlate with precision-weighted interoceptive prediction errors (potentially reflected in insula/ACC activity), rather than purely objective physiological states or traditional reward-related activity alone. Experiments manipulating the discrepancy between predicted and actual interoceptive states (even if objective states are similar) should systematically alter reported valence.
*   **Falsification:** If valence ratings consistently dissociate from measures of interoceptive prediction error (while correlating strongly with objective physiology or context-independent reward signals), or if manipulations designed to alter prediction error fail to modulate valence, this would challenge EPET's specific explanation of *Vedanā*.

**Prediction 3: Disrupted predictive self-model stability during "no-self" meditation correlates with ego dissolution.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** The sense of self is a construct of predictive self-modeling (PP + *Saṅkhāra*); meditative practices targeting the self should modulate this process.
*   **Prediction:** Deep meditation states associated with "no-self" experiences or ego dissolution reports should correlate with specific, measurable changes in neural and computational markers of predictive self-modeling. This could manifest as **decreased precision or temporal stability** of predictions concerning body ownership, agency, or metacognitive self-evaluation, potentially measurable via EEG/fMRI or behavioral tasks probing these functions during or after meditation. The magnitude of these neuro-computational changes should correlate with the reported depth of the "no-self" experience.
*   **Falsification:** If profound "no-self" states consistently occur without detectable alterations in relevant predictive self-model parameters (despite changes in other brain states like general relaxation), or if observed changes are non-specific or contradictory to the model (e.g., increased stability of self-predictions).

**Prediction 4: Causal role of embodied active inference in stabilizing percepts.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Embodied action, as active inference, is integral to the prediction error minimization process that stabilizes conscious perception.
*   **Prediction:** In bistable perception paradigms (e.g., Necker cube), allowing participants to perform subtle, task-relevant motor actions (like micro-saccades or head-tilts, interpreted as active sampling to confirm/disconfirm the current perceptual hypothesis) should **significantly increase perceptual stability** (longer dominance durations) compared to conditions where such actions are restricted (e.g., strict fixation). The stabilizing effect should be specific to actions that can provide information relevant to disambiguating the percept.
*   **Falsification:** If the ability to engage in relevant active inference (action) provides no stabilization advantage over passive viewing, or if *any* motor action (even task-irrelevant) leads to similar destabilization, contradicting the proposed functional role of action in perceptual inference.

## Final Statement:

EPET is proposed not as the final word, but as a **fruitful, coherent, empirically grounded framework**. By synthesizing predictive processing, global access, embodiment, emergentism, and Buddhist insights, EPET aims to advance our understanding of subjective experience, stimulating further discussion, critique, and research.
