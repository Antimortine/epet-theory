# 8. Conclusion: EPET as an Integrative Framework for Understanding Consciousness

This work presented the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), an integrative philosophical theory of consciousness based on non-reductive physicalism. EPET views consciousness as a **real, emergent, dynamic, embodied process** arising from the specific organization and activity of the brain-body-environment system.

EPET’s primary contribution is its integrated, non-reductive synthesis: it constitutively explains qualia as intrinsic features of hierarchical Predictive Processing and grounds the sense of self in dynamically maintained self-models compatible with the no-self principle. This unified account overcomes key challenges—such as the 'hard problem', the Cartesian Theater, and the substance-dualism bias—by showing how conscious experience and selfhood emerge naturally from precision-weighted inference and global broadcasting.

Building on this synthesis, EPET relies on two central mechanisms and two core constructs:

-   **Predictive Processing (PP):** Generating content and quality through hierarchical Bayesian inference, where precision-weighted priors and sensory evidence dynamically shape experience.
    
-   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Facilitating integration and conscious access via recurrent loops and ignition mechanisms that broadcast high-level hypotheses across distributed networks.
    
-   **Qualia:** Understood as intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive modeling process, reflecting the relevance and contextual embedding of representational states.
    
-   **Self:** Interpreted as a dynamically maintained self-model, aligning with the no-self principle by emphasizing the processual and non-substantial nature of personal identity.
    

## 8.1. Main Achievements and Strengths of EPET

EPET's primary contribution lies in its **systematic philosophical synthesis** of contemporary consciousness science, Western philosophy, and select Buddhist concepts. This yields several strengths: **(1)** A coherent framework grounded in **non-reductive emergentist physicalism**, avoiding metaphysical extremes while affirming subjective reality. **(2)** A principled integration of core mechanisms (PP, GWT, Embodiment) with a **specific philosophical interpretation** addressing subjectivity and selfhood, potentially more deeply than frameworks focused solely on function or computation. **(3)** A **constitutive explanation of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the integrated, embodied predictive process, offering a naturalistic approach to the 'hard problem'. **(4)** A naturalistic, **Anattā-compatible account of the self** as a dynamic, constructed self-model. **(5)** Significant **heuristic value**, generating novel, testable hypotheses from its unique synthesis and offering a comprehensive structure for explaining experience. **(6)** Conceptual enrichment via **Buddhist philosophy** (the no-self principle and a processual ontology) providing constraints and guidance towards a non-substantialist view. In essence, EPET offers a systematically articulated philosophical interpretation of how consciousness emerges from complex physical systems.


## 8.2. Acknowledging Current Limitations and Open Questions

Like any contemporary theory, EPET faces limitations and open questions. **(1)** Its constitutive explanation of qualia (Section 4.4), while coherent within emergentist physicalism, may not resolve the 'hard problem' for all perspectives. **(2)** The precise mechanisms require further specification, particularly the neural dynamics of the PP↔GWT interface (Section 3.1), the generation of affective valence from interoceptive prediction errors, and the detailed processes of the predictive self-model. **(3)** Rigorous empirical validation of EPET's core integrative claims and specific hypotheses (Section 8.4) is needed. **(4)** The theory's current scope primarily covers normative waking consciousness and needs systematic extension to altered states and pathologies. **(5)** The integration of Buddhist concepts requires ongoing scrutiny regarding philosophical interpretation and scientific utility. **(6)** EPET's applicability to non-human animals and AI necessitates further theoretical adaptation and empirical work. Addressing these points is crucial for EPET's continued development.
    

## 8.3. Directions for Future Research

The EPET framework suggests several promising research directions. Key areas include: **(1)** Developing a detailed EPET-based account of **affective valence**, linking interoceptive prediction errors, precision, and self-models to the spectrum of feeling tones and integrating with theories of emotion. **(2)** Articulating a compatibilist model of **free will** grounded in EPET's account of conscious access, predictive self-modeling, and precision/attention in decision-making. **(3)** Exploring implications for **artificial consciousness**, using EPET's principles (hierarchical prediction, global workspace analogue, embodied self-modeling, relevance evaluation) as criteria for designing and assessing conscious AI. **(4)** Investigating **psychopathology** (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis) through the lens of EPET as specific disruptions in Predictive Processing, global access, or self-modeling mechanisms. Further theoretical work should refine the PP-GWT interface and extend EPET's scope (e.g., to ASCs, social cognition), while empirical work should test its core predictions using advanced experimental methods (Section 8.4).

## 8.4. Testable Hypotheses Derived from EPET

A key strength of EPET lies in its capacity to generate specific, potentially falsifiable hypotheses that bridge philosophical claims with empirical science. These predictions arise directly from EPET’s unique synthesis of Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment, and its specific philosophical commitments (e.g., regarding the self-model). Testing these hypotheses probes the coherence and explanatory power of the integrated framework.

For example, EPET predicts that **(1) interoceptive states dynamically modulate conscious access** to external stimuli: high-precision interoceptive prediction errors (e.g., induced physiological stress) should raise the threshold for unrelated external stimuli to enter the global workspace, measurable via psychophysics and neuroimaging (e.g., P3b changes). It also predicts that **(2) perturbations of the predictive self-model impact perception**: inducing states like "ego dissolution" (e.g., via meditation or psychedelics) should decrease perceptual stability (e.g., faster bistable switching) and alter global access thresholds, correlating with subjective reports and neural markers of self-model disruption.

Further detailed hypotheses, including predictions regarding the role of the self-model in affective valence, the impact of agency on active inference, and specific neurodynamic signatures of the PP-GWT interface, are elaborated in the Supplementary Materials (Section C). Successfully testing such predictions would lend significant empirical credence to EPET's core integrative claims.

## 8.5. Final Statement

The Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) is put forth not as a definitive or final solution to the enigma of consciousness, but as a **fruitful, coherent, and empirically grounded philosophical framework**. It offers a **constitutive, mechanistic, and naturalistic explanation** of subjective experience, developed within the bounds of non-reductive physicalism. EPET's distinctiveness lies in its **systematic philosophical synthesis** of core mechanisms from Predictive Processing and Global Workspace Theory, integrated with principles of Embodied Cognition and emergentist metaphysics, and uniquely guided by select conceptual insights from Buddhist philosophy. By weaving these diverse threads into a unified structure, EPET aims to advance our understanding of how phenomenal experience and a sense of self can arise from complex physical systems, thereby stimulating further interdisciplinary discussion, critical evaluation, and novel avenues of research.
