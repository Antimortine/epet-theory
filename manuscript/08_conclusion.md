# 8. Conclusion: EPET as an Integrative Framework for Understanding Consciousness

This work has presented the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) – an attempt to formulate an integrative philosophical theory of consciousness based on the principles of non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism. EPET views consciousness not as a mysterious entity or a fundamental property, but as a **real, emergent, dynamic, and embodied process** arising from the specific organization and activity of the brain-body-environment system.

The key mechanisms realizing this process in EPET are **Predictive Processing (PP)**, responsible for generating the content and quality of experience through the constant construction and updating of models of the world and self, and the **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**, ensuring integration, stabilization, and conscious access to this information. The subjective quality of experience (**qualia**) is explained as an **intrinsic property of the integrated predictive modeling process itself**, reflecting the way the system represents interactions and their relevance. The phenomenal **sense of "self"** is interpreted not as a reflection of a substantial soul, but as a **dynamic construct of self-modeling** within the predictive system, which fully aligns with the Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā (no-self)** and is supported by data from neuroscience and studies of altered states of consciousness.

## Main Achievements and Strengths of EPET:

The main strength of EPET lies in its **integrative approach**. It successfully synthesizes data and concepts from three distinct domains:

*   Contemporary **sciences of consciousness**, utilizing the powerful theoretical frameworks of PP and GWT and drawing on a wide range of empirical data.
*   **Western philosophy of mind**, offering an emergentist metaphysical foundation and addressing the classic problems of qualia, the "self," and mental causation.
*   **Buddhist philosophy and psychology**, using its key principles (*Anattā*, *Anicca*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*) and phenomenological analysis (*Khandhas*) as conceptual guides and constraints.

Thanks to this synthesis, EPET offers a **scientifically grounded**, yet **non-reductive** explanation of consciousness that avoids the extremes of dualism, panpsychism, and illusionism. The theory presents a **coherent explanation** of both the content and structure of experience, as well as its subjective quality and the sense of "self." Compliance with the three initial criteria (scientific plausibility, compatibility with the core of Buddhism, philosophical form) confirms its conceptual thoroughness. An important strength is also the **heuristic value** of EPET as a framework capable of generating new hypotheses and stimulating interdisciplinary dialogue.

## Acknowledgment of Limitations and Open Questions:

Despite its merits, EPET, like any theory of consciousness at the current stage of scientific and philosophical development, has its limitations and leaves open questions:

*   Although EPET offers a strategy for addressing the **"hard problem"** by explaining qualia as properties of the process, the intuition of an "explanatory gap" may persist, and the persuasiveness of this explanation remains a subject of debate.
*   **Further detailing** of the precise neural and computational mechanisms realizing the interaction between PP and GWT, the emergence of consciousness from neural activity, and especially the mechanism generating affective valence from interoceptive prediction is required.
*   Targeted **empirical research** is needed to test the specific hypotheses derived from EPET.
*   Perhaps the current version of EPET does not sufficiently cover the full spectrum of conscious phenomena (e.g., complex cognitive emotions, the role of language, subtle aspects of the temporal structure of experience).
*   The employed **interpretation of Buddhist concepts** is one of several possibilities and may be refined or contested in dialogue with Buddhist scholars.

## Directions for Future Research:

EPET opens several promising avenues for further work:

*   **Theoretical:** Refining the model of PP-GWT interaction; integrating EPET with theories of emotion, motivation, and social cognition; investigating the connection between EPET mechanisms and various meditative practices and their effects; further philosophical analysis of the nature of qualia and self-modeling within the theory; possibly developing formal or computational models implementing EPET principles.
*   **Empirical:** Developing new experimental paradigms to study the neural correlates of predictions, errors, precision, valence, and their relationship with subjective reports; using neurostimulation techniques to test the causal role of different brain regions and networks in EPET mechanisms; further investigation of ASCs as models for studying the plasticity of consciousness and self-awareness.

## Testable Hypotheses of EPET

EPET generates several testable hypotheses. For example, the integrative nature of EPET leads to the following specific, potentially falsifiable predictions.

**Prediction 1: Dissociation between qualia intensity and conscious access under manipulation of prediction precision.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** The phenomenal quality/intensity of experience (qualia) is constituted by the predictive modeling process (PP), especially its stability and precision, whereas conscious access for report requires global availability (GWT).
*   **Prediction:** In experimental paradigms (e.g., using near-threshold stimuli or binocular rivalry), one can independently manipulate: (a) the expected precision of the sensory signal (e.g., via priming or stimulus statistics), affecting PP, and (b) the need for report or the task-relevance of the stimulus, affecting GWT. EPET predicts that **manipulations of expected precision (a) will more strongly affect subjective ratings of the intensity or clarity of the experience (even without report), whereas manipulations of the need for report (b) will more strongly affect the possibility of reporting the stimulus itself and the neural markers of late global activation (P3b, fronto-parietal activity) associated with GWT.**
*   **Falsification:** If the intensity/clarity of experience depends solely on late GWT markers, or if reportability is modulated only by early PP-related parameters (regardless of the task), this would challenge EPET's proposed division of labor between PP and GWT.

**Prediction 2: Affective valence as a result of minimizing interoceptive prediction error.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** The subjective quality of affective valence (*Vedanā* - pleasant/unpleasant) is a property of the interoceptive predictive modeling process and reflects the success/failure in minimizing interoceptive prediction error relative to homeostatic goals.
*   **Prediction:** In tasks where one can measure objective physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, galvanic skin response), their prediction by the brain (e.g., via neural activity in the insula/anterior cingulate cortex), and subjective valence ratings, EPET predicts that **subjective valence will correlate more strongly not with the physiological state itself, but with the magnitude and sign (possibly precision-weighted) of the prediction error of that state relative to the expected/target homeostatic range.** Manipulations that increase (or decrease) interoceptive prediction error (even with similar objective states) should lead to more negative (or positive) subjective valence.
*   **Falsification:** If valence correlates only with the objective physiological state or only with the activity of "classic" pleasure/displeasure centers, independently of the parameters of the predictive model of interoception, this would weaken EPET's specific explanation of *Vedanā*.

**Prediction 3: Disruption of predictive self-model stability during "no-self" meditation correlates with the phenomenology of ego dissolution.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** The sense of "self" is a construct of predictive self-modeling (PP + *Saṅkhāra*), compatible with *Anattā*. Meditative practices aimed at deconstructing the "self" should affect this mechanism.
*   **Prediction:** In meditation practitioners (especially those engaged in Vipassanā-like practices or specific "no-self" techniques) during deep meditation accompanied by subjective reports of "ego dissolution" or a weakened sense of self, **specific changes in the neural and computational markers of predictive self-modeling should be observed**. Specifically, a **decrease in the precision or temporal stability** of predictions related to body boundaries, sense of agency, and metacognitive self-assessments is expected. The degree of these measurable changes should correlate with the depth of the subjectively experienced "no-self" state.
*   **Falsification:** If deep "no-self" states are not accompanied by measurable changes in the parameters of the predictive self-model (while changes occur in other brain systems), or if these changes are of a completely different nature (e.g., just a general decrease in activity), this would challenge EPET's proposed link between *Anattā* and the self-modeling mechanism in PP.

**Prediction 4: Causal role of embodied active inference in stabilizing conscious percepts.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Consciousness is embodied, and active inference is an integral part of the prediction error minimization process that stabilizes perception.
*   **Prediction:** In situations involving bistable or multistable perception (e.g., Necker cube, binocular rivalry), where passive observation leads to spontaneous perceptual switches, **the ability to perform subtle, task-relevant motor actions (e.g., eye micro-movements, head movements, or even finger movements if linked to the task) aimed at confirming the current perceptual hypothesis (i.e., active sampling to minimize prediction error) should lead to increased stability of the current conscious percept** (increased dominance duration). Blocking such actions (e.g., via strict gaze fixation or motor restriction) should, conversely, increase perceptual instability. The effect should be specific to actions relevant to the current hypothesis.
*   **Falsification:** If the possibility of active inference does not affect the stability of bistable perception, or if any actions (even irrelevant ones) lead to destabilization, this would contradict EPET's idea of the constructive role of active inference in shaping conscious experience.

## Final Statement:

The Emergent Predictive Experience Theory does not claim to be the final word in the study of consciousness. Its primary goal is to offer a **fruitful, coherent, and empirically grounded theoretical framework** capable of integrating knowledge from various disciplines and traditions. By synthesizing ideas from predictive processing, global access, embodiment, emergentism, and key insights from Buddhist philosophy, EPET aims to chart a path toward a more complete and profound understanding of the nature of subjective experience and our place in the world. We hope that the proposed theory will serve as a stimulus for further discussions, critique, and, most importantly, for new research on the exciting journey of understanding consciousness.
