# 8. Conclusion: EPET as an Integrative Framework for Understanding Consciousness

This work presented the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), an integrative philosophical theory of consciousness based on non-reductive physicalism. EPET views consciousness as a **real, emergent, dynamic, embodied process** arising from the specific organization and activity of the brain-body-environment system.

EPET’s primary contribution is its integrated, non-reductive synthesis: it constitutively explains qualia as intrinsic features of hierarchical predictive processing and grounds the sense of self in dynamically maintained self-models compatible with the Anattā doctrine. This unified account overcomes key challenges—such as the “Hard Problem,” the Cartesian Theater, and the substance-dualism bias—by showing how conscious experience and selfhood emerge naturally from precision-weighted inference and global broadcasting.

Building on this synthesis, EPET relies on two central mechanisms and two core constructs:

- **Predictive Processing (PP):** Generating content and quality through hierarchical Bayesian inference, where precision-weighted priors and sensory evidence dynamically shape experience.
- **Global Workspace Theory (GWT):** Facilitating integration and conscious access via recurrent loops and ignition mechanisms that broadcast high-level hypotheses across distributed networks.
- **Qualia:** Understood as intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive modeling process, reflecting the relevance and contextual embedding of representational states.
- **Self:** Interpreted as a dynamically maintained self-model, aligning with the Anattā doctrine by emphasizing the processual and non-substantial nature of personal identity.

## Main Achievements and Strengths of EPET:

EPET's strength is its **integrative approach**, synthesizing insights from consciousness science (PP, GWT), Western philosophy (emergentism), and Buddhist philosophy (*Anattā*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*). This yields a **scientifically grounded, non-reductive** explanation avoiding extremes (dualism, panpsychism, illusionism), offering a **coherent account** of experience's content, quality, and self-sense, with significant **heuristic value**.

## Acknowledgment of Limitations and Open Questions:

EPET, like any current theory, has limitations:

- The "hard problem" response remains debatable.
- Mechanistic details (PP-GWT interaction, valence generation) need refinement.
- More empirical testing is required.
- The full spectrum of phenomena might not be covered.
- Buddhist concept interpretations can be discussed.
- Underspecified PP↔GWT mechanisms: Although EPET posits that precision-weighted prediction errors are broadcast via recurrent loops and phase synchrony, the exact neural implementation—e.g., the cellular circuits mediating precision tagging and the temporal dynamics of global ignition—remains to be empirically detailed.
- Boundaries of applicability: EPET’s framework assumes human-like hierarchical inference architectures; its applicability to non-human animals with different predictive hierarchies or to artificial systems (e.g., deep learning networks) requires further theoretical adaptation and experimental validation.

## Directions for Future Research:

Future work includes: **Theoretical** (refining models, integrating with emotion/social cognition, exploring meditation links, formal/computational modeling) and **Empirical** (new paradigms for testing correlates of prediction/error/precision/valence, neurostimulation, ASC studies).

## Testable Hypotheses of EPET

EPET generates specific, potentially falsifiable hypotheses:

**Prediction 1 (Revised): Interaction of Interoceptive State and Exteroceptive Access.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Conscious access (GWT) to exteroceptive stimuli is not solely determined by stimulus strength/task relevance but is dynamically modulated by the organism's ongoing interoceptive state (PP-based valence/arousal signals reflecting *Vedanā*). Specifically, high-precision negative interoceptive prediction errors (signaling threat/homeostatic imbalance) might prioritize internal monitoring, raising the threshold for accessing external, non-threatening stimuli, even if they are physically salient. This integrates PP (interoceptive prediction/precision), GWT (access threshold), and embodiment.
*   **Prediction:** In attentional blink or perceptual threshold tasks, inducing a mild, controlled interoceptive challenge (e.g., unexpected physiological perturbation like slight dyspnea or cold pressor test, carefully controlled) compared to a neutral baseline should **increase the threshold** for conscious report (GWT access, indexed by P3b latency/amplitude or report accuracy) of *task-irrelevant* but physically salient exteroceptive stimuli, while potentially *enhancing* access for stimuli perceived as relevant to the interoceptive state. Subjective ratings of valence/anxiety should mediate this effect.
*   **Methods:** EEG, psychophysiology (ECG, respiration), psychophysics (attentional blink, masking), subjective reports.
*   **Falsification:** Conscious access threshold for external stimuli remains unchanged despite significant manipulation of interoceptive prediction error/affective state; or, interoceptive state only affects overall arousal/performance non-specifically, without the predicted interaction with stimulus relevance/access thresholds. This would challenge the proposed integration of interoceptive PP modulation with GWT access mechanisms.
    

**Prediction 2: Self-Attribution Modulates Affective Valence.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** The subjective affective valence (Vedanā) arising from an interoceptive prediction error (PP mechanism) is modulated by the predictive self-model (PP construct, Saṅkhāra). Attributing the physiological change underlying the error to an internal, self-related cause versus an external, non-self cause should alter the resulting phenomenal feel, even if the raw error signal is identical. This integrates interoceptive PP, self-modeling PP, and the Buddhist concept of constructed self influencing experience.
-   **Prediction:** Using ambiguous physiological feedback paradigms (e.g., false heart-rate feedback), experimentally manipulate participants' belief about the source of a perceived change (e.g., "due to your emotional reaction" vs. "due to the equipment/external stimulus"). EPET predicts that attributing the change to 'self' will result in **different subjective valence/arousal ratings** (and potentially different neural correlates in insula/ACC/mPFC) compared to attributing the identical physiological signal change to an external source. The strength of self-related DMN activity might correlate with the degree of modulation.
-   **Methods:** fMRI/EEG, psychophysiology, false feedback paradigms, subjective reports, potentially TMS over DMN nodes.
-   **Falsification:** Subjective valence ratings are solely determined by the magnitude/direction of the (manipulated) physiological signal, irrespective of causal attribution; no significant difference in subjective report or neural correlates based on attribution manipulation. This would challenge the integration of self-modeling with the generation of affective qualia.
    

**Prediction 3: Disrupted Self-Model Alters Perceptual Binding and Stability.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** The stability and precision of the predictive self-model (PP construct, related to Anattā state) acts as a high-level prior influencing lower-level perceptual inference. Disrupting this self-model (e.g., via meditation, psychedelics, or TMS) should decrease the top-down stabilization of perceptual interpretations, leading to measurable changes in perceptual binding and bistable perception dynamics, potentially allowing weaker or unusual interpretations global access (GWT). This integrates self-modeling PP, perceptual PP, and GWT.
-   **Prediction:** Inducing states of reduced self-focus or ego dissolution (e.g., post-mindfulness meditation, potentially low-dose psychedelics in controlled settings, or TMS targeting DMN hubs) should lead to **decreased stability in bistable perception** (e.g., faster switching rates for Necker cube/binocular rivalry) and potentially **increased susceptibility to illusory conjunctions** in feature binding tasks, compared to a control state. These perceptual changes should correlate with markers of reduced self-model precision (e.g., decreased DMN coherence, specific questionnaire scores).
-   **Methods:** EEG/fMRI, psychophysics (bistable perception, feature binding tasks), meditation/ASC induction protocols, subjective reports (e.g., Ego Dissolution Inventory), potentially TMS.
-   **Falsification:** States of ego dissolution show no systematic effect on perceptual stability or binding, or the effects are non-specific (e.g., general decrease in attention); perceptual changes do not correlate with markers of self-model disruption. This would challenge the proposed role of the self-model as a high-level prior influencing perception and access.
    

**Prediction 4: Sense of Agency Modulates Active Inference Efficacy.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** The effectiveness of embodied action (active inference) in resolving perceptual uncertainty and stabilizing percepts (PP mechanism) is modulated by the phenomenal sense of agency, which is part of the predictive self-model (PP construct). Actions performed with a strong sense of agency should be more effective at minimizing prediction error and stabilizing the accessed percept (GWT) than identical actions performed passively or with experimentally reduced agency. This integrates active inference (PP/Embodiment), self-modeling (PP/Agency), and GWT (stabilization of accessed percept).
-   **Prediction:** In a task where participants use subtle motor actions (e.g., eye movements, manual adjustments) to disambiguate a noisy or bistable stimulus, manipulating the perceived sense of agency over those actions (e.g., using slight delays or distortions in action-feedback loops, instructions biasing agency attribution) will modulate perceptual outcomes. Specifically, **higher reported sense of agency** should correlate with **faster perceptual resolution and/or greater stability** of the chosen percept, even when the physical action and sensory information are matched across conditions. Neural markers of agency (e.g., readiness potential attenuation, specific parietal activity) should correlate with both subjective agency and perceptual stabilization.
-   **Methods:** Motion tracking, EEG, psychophysics (perceptual stabilization/disambiguation tasks), agency manipulation paradigms, subjective reports (sense of agency scales).
-   **Falsification:** Perceptual stabilization/resolution depends only on the physical action and resulting sensory input, irrespective of the manipulated sense of agency; no correlation between neural/subjective markers of agency and the effectiveness of active inference. This would challenge the integration of the self-model (agency) with the embodied mechanisms of active perceptual inference.


## Final Statement:

EPET is proposed not as the final word, but as a fruitful, coherent, empirically grounded framework offering a **constitutive, mechanistic, and naturalistic explanation** of subjective experience within non-reductive physicalism. By synthesizing predictive processing, global access, embodiment, emergentism, and Buddhist insights, EPET aims to advance our understanding of subjective experience, stimulating further discussion, critique, and research.
