# 8. Conclusion: EPET as an Integrative Framework for Understanding Consciousness

This work presented the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), an integrative philosophical theory of consciousness based on non-reductive physicalism. EPET views consciousness as a **real, emergent, dynamic, embodied process** arising from the specific organization and activity of the brain-body-environment system.

Key mechanisms are **Predictive Processing (PP)** (generating content/quality via modeling) and **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** (integration, access). **Qualia** are explained as **intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive modeling process**, reflecting interaction representation and relevance. The **"self"** is interpreted as a **dynamic construct of self-modeling**, aligning with **Anattā (no-self)**, supported by neuroscience/ASC studies.

## Main Achievements and Strengths of EPET:

EPET's strength is its **integrative approach**, synthesizing insights from consciousness science (PP, GWT), Western philosophy (emergentism), and Buddhist philosophy (*Anattā*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*). This yields a **scientifically grounded, non-reductive** explanation avoiding extremes (dualism, panpsychism, illusionism), offering a **coherent account** of experience's content, quality, and self-sense, with significant **heuristic value**.

## Acknowledgment of Limitations and Open Questions:

EPET, like any current theory, has limitations: the "hard problem" response remains debatable; mechanistic details (PP-GWT interaction, valence generation) need refinement; more empirical testing is required; the full spectrum of phenomena might not be covered; Buddhist concept interpretations can be discussed.

## Directions for Future Research:

Future work includes: **Theoretical** (refining models, integrating with emotion/social cognition, exploring meditation links, formal/computational modeling) and **Empirical** (new paradigms for testing correlates of prediction/error/precision/valence, neurostimulation, ASC studies).

## Testable Hypotheses of EPET

EPET generates specific, potentially falsifiable hypotheses:

**Prediction 1: Dissociation between qualia intensity and access via precision manipulation.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Qualia intensity depends on PP stability/precision; Access depends on GWT availability.
*   **Prediction:** In relevant paradigms (e.g., near-threshold stimuli), manipulating expected sensory precision should primarily affect subjective intensity/clarity ratings, while manipulating task relevance/report need should primarily affect reportability and late GWT-related neural markers (e.g., P3b).
*   **Falsification:** If intensity solely depends on late GWT markers, or reportability solely on early PP parameters regardless of task demands, challenging the proposed PP/GWT division of labor.

**Prediction 2: Affective valence reflects interoceptive prediction error minimization.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Valence (*Vedanā*) reflects success/failure in minimizing interoceptive prediction errors relative to homeostatic set-points.
*   **Prediction:** Subjective valence ratings should correlate more strongly with the magnitude/sign of (precision-weighted) interoceptive prediction error (activity in insula/ACC) than with the objective physiological state itself. Manipulating prediction error should shift valence accordingly.
*   **Falsification:** If valence correlates only with objective physiology or 'classic' reward/punishment centers, irrespective of interoceptive predictive model parameters.

**Prediction 3: Disrupted predictive self-model stability during "no-self" meditation correlates with ego dissolution.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Self-sense is a predictive self-model construct (PP + *Saṅkhāra*); meditation targeting the self should modulate it.
*   **Prediction:** Deep "no-self" meditation states accompanied by ego dissolution reports should show measurable **decreases in precision or stability** of predictive signals related to self-representation (body boundaries, agency, metacognition). The degree of neural/computational change should correlate with subjective report intensity.
*   **Falsification:** If profound "no-self" experiences occur without corresponding measurable changes in predictive self-model parameters, or if observed changes are non-specific.

**Prediction 4: Causal role of embodied active inference in stabilizing percepts.**

*   **EPET Hypothesis:** Embodied action (active inference) is integral to error minimization that stabilizes conscious perception.
*   **Prediction:** In bistable perception paradigms, allowing task-relevant motor actions (e.g., micro-saccades, head-tilts aimed at sampling evidence for the current percept) should **increase perceptual stability** (dominance duration) compared to passive viewing. Blocking such actions should decrease stability.
*   **Falsification:** If active inference capability does not influence perceptual stability, or if *any* motor activity (even irrelevant) destabilizes perception.

## Final Statement:

EPET is proposed not as the final word, but as a **fruitful, coherent, empirically grounded framework**. By synthesizing predictive processing, global access, embodiment, emergentism, and Buddhist insights, EPET aims to advance our understanding of subjective experience, stimulating further discussion, critique, and research.
