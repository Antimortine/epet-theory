# 7. Discussion of Potential Objections to EPET

Any new theoretical development, especially in such a complex and debated field as the philosophy of consciousness, inevitably faces criticism and objections. Anticipating and responding to potential criticism is an important part of presenting and evaluating a theory. In this section, we will consider some of the most likely objections against the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) and offer responses within the framework of the theory itself.

## 7.1. Objection 1: The "Hard Problem" Remains Unsolved

*   **Objection:** EPET's claim that qualia are "intrinsic characteristics of the emergent process" (Section 4.1) might be perceived as a semantic move or redescription that fails to solve the fundamental mystery: *why* this specific physical process should possess a subjective, qualitative aspect at all, and *why* it feels *this* way rather than some other way or no way. It seems the "explanatory gap" [@levineMaterialismQualiaExplanatory1983] between the physical process and phenomenal quality persists.
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET acknowledges the intuitive force of this objection, which lies at the heart of the "hard problem" of consciousness. However, the theory suggests that this intuition may stem from incorrect presuppositions or a category mistake, especially when viewed from the perspective of **emergentist physicalism** adopted by EPET. The expectation that qualia should be something *over and above* the complex physical process, or that there should be a simple logical or nomological 'derivation' of the subjective from the objective, might itself be a consequence of implicit dualism [see critique of such intuitions in @dennettQuiningQualia1988; @churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981].

    EPET's strategy is not to 'leap' across the explanatory gap, but to **reframe the question itself** (as outlined in Section 4.4). If we accept that consciousness is a real emergent process arising from the specific organization of underlying physical processes, the question shifts from the metaphysical "why does P generate Q?" to the scientific-philosophical "how does P realize Q?". That is: "**What are the specific properties of the emergent physical process P (in terms of integrated predictive modeling) that *realize* or *constitute* the phenomenal characteristics we call qualia Q?**"

    EPET provides a **mechanistic explanation** (Section 4.2), detailing how parameters of the process (activity patterns, dynamics, precision, interoceptive relevance assessment) constitute different aspects of phenomenal experience (quality, intensity, valence).

    The key is the **"Nothing Extra" argument**. Just as we do not seek an additional "essence of fluidity" beyond the dynamics of water molecules, or a "life force" (*élan vital*) beyond complex biochemical processes, EPET argues that within emergentist physicalism, there is no reason to expect anything beyond the specific, complexly organized process of integrated predictive modeling itself. The "what-it's-likeness" is not an additional, mysterious entity. **The "what-it's-likeness" *is* what this process is like from the inside, from the system's own perspective, at its emergent level.**

    Thus, EPET does not claim to offer a complete metaphysical "solution" to the hard problem that would satisfy a dualist. Instead, EPET provides the most comprehensive and coherent naturalistic framework for **explaining the structure, functions, characteristics, and realization mechanisms** of conscious experience available within contemporary science and emergentist philosophy. It shows how a physical system can realize phenomenality, leaving open the ultimate metaphysical question of why such realization is possible in the universe.

## 7.2. Objection 2: EPET as Compilation (Lack of Novelty)

*   **Objection:** EPET relies heavily on existing scientific theories of Predictive Processing (PP) [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], which might raise doubts about its originality – isn't it just their sum or relabeling?
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET openly acknowledges the use of PP and GWT as its key *mechanistic components*. However, its novelty and contribution lie not in inventing these mechanisms, but in their: 1) **Integration** into a single coherent structure, where PP is responsible for generating content/quality, and GWT for access/integration. 2) **Philosophical Interpretation** of these mechanisms within emergentist physicalism, including a specific explanation of qualia as properties of the process and the "self" as a self-modeling construct. 3) **Synthesis with the conceptual principles of Buddhism** (*Anattā*, *Anicca*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*), which gives the theory a unique direction and constraints. EPET is a **philosophical theory** using scientific models to address fundamental philosophical problems of consciousness.

## 7.3. Objection 3: Vagueness of "Emergence"

*   **Objection:** The concept of emergence is often criticized for being vague and lacking explanatory power [see discussion of difficulties in @kimMindPhysicalWorld2000] – isn't it just an admission of ignorance about how exactly consciousness arises?
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET employs a specific type of emergence – **weak/epistemic** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997; @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006], which does not posit violations of physical laws but points to the impossibility of fully explaining and predicting high-level properties (consciousness) solely in the language of low-level components. Importantly, EPET does not merely declare emergence but also **identifies a set of specific organizational principles and mechanisms** (PP hierarchy, recurrence, GWT integration, embodiment, self-modeling, relevance assessment) considered necessary conditions for the emergence of consciousness. Defining the precise thresholds and implementation details of these mechanisms is a task for future empirical research, for which EPET provides a theoretical framework.

## 7.4. Objection 4: The Boundary Problem (Gradual vs. Threshold)

*   **Objection:** How does EPET define the boundary between conscious and unconscious processes? Is consciousness within the theory strictly threshold-based ("all-or-nothing") or gradual?
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET proposes a **hybrid model**. It is suggested that the **phenomenal quality and intensity** of experience, generated within PP, can be **gradual**, depending on modeling parameters (stability, precision, etc.). However, **conscious access** to this information, enabled by the GWT mechanism, likely has a more **threshold-like character** [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005]. This allows explaining both the spectrum of intensity and clarity in conscious experiences and the relatively sharp transition to reportability and control over information upon crossing the threshold of global availability.

## 7.5. Objection 5: Epiphenomenalism (Causal Efficacy of Qualia)

*   **Objection:** If consciousness and qualia are emergent properties of a physical process, doesn't this mean they are causally inert "passive shadows" (epiphenomena) [see argument in @ludlowTheresSomethingMary2004; review in @robinsonEpiphenomenalism2023], with all the real causal work being done at the underlying neural level?
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET rejects epiphenomenalism. Within the adopted **non-reductive emergentism** and an **interventionist/counterfactual understanding of causation** [@woodwardMakingThingsHappen2005], the conscious process as a whole is causally efficacious at its own level. Qualia, being **intrinsic properties** of this process (e.g., valence or intensity), are aspects of its causal efficacy (a change in qualia = a change in the process = a change in consequences). High-level causal descriptions in terms of conscious states and their qualities are not only valid but often more informative [@dennettIntentionalStanceMIT1987].

## 7.6. Objection 6: Incorrectness or Irrelevance of Using Buddhism

*   **Objection:** Integrating Buddhist concepts might seem either superficial and distorting authentic teachings, or fundamentally inappropriate for a strictly scientific or philosophical theory.
*   **EPET's Response:** EPET addresses not the religious aspects, but the **philosophical core of Buddhism** [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012], interpreting it in a contemporary context. The value of this engagement is seen in gaining an **alternative conceptual perspective**, **phenomenological landmarks** (e.g., the importance of *Vedanā*), and **conceptual constraints** (e.g., the need for an explanation without a "self"), which enrich the theory. EPET's argumentation is built on a scientific and philosophical basis; Buddhism is used to demonstrate the **convergence of ideas** and to fulfill one of the initial criteria of the theory – seeking compatibility with this profound tradition of mind inquiry.

## 7.7. Objection 7: Unfalsifiability of the Theory

*   **Objection:** EPET's claims, especially about the nature of qualia as "properties of the process," might seem too abstract and difficult to test or falsify empirically [@popperLogicScientificDiscovery2005].
*   **EPET's Response:** Like other broad philosophical or theoretical frameworks, EPET as a whole is not falsifiable by a single crucial experiment. However, it is not empirically empty. EPET **generates a number of testable hypotheses** (see Section 8.4) at the intersection of its components (PP, GWT) and claims about phenomenology (correlation of modeling parameters with reports on qualia, prediction of manipulation effects, etc.). The evaluation of EPET, like any theory at this level, should be based on its **internal consistency, explanatory power, ability to integrate data, predictive capacity (regarding new experiments), and comparison with alternative theories** [see @kuhnStructureScientificRevolutions1997; @lakatosMethodologyScientific1978].

## 7.8. Section Conclusion

The objections discussed highlight potential difficulties and areas for further development of EPET. Nevertheless, the proposed responses demonstrate that the theory possesses sufficient internal coherence and conceptual resources to address major criticisms. Acknowledging the existence of open questions and the need for further research (both theoretical and empirical), EPET presents itself as a heuristically valuable and well-founded approach to understanding consciousness.
