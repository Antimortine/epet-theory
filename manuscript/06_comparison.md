# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other prominent theories of consciousness highlights its distinctive philosophical positioning and explanatory strengths. EPET is proposed as an integrative, non-reductive physicalist framework, which uniquely synthesizes mechanisms from Predictive Processing and Global Workspace Theory through an emergentist lens; a synthesis that is further conceptually enriched and constrained by select insights from Buddhist philosophy.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] core mechanism of global availability, as elaborated in its neural form (GNWT) by Dehaene and colleagues [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], to explain **conscious access**, the integration of information, and the unity of experience.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While GWT/GNWT primarily focuses on the mechanisms of conscious access and broadcast, it offers a less detailed account of how the specific content and qualitative character of conscious states are generated. EPET **supplements GWT/GNWT** by incorporating **Predictive Processing (PP)** [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the fundamental mechanism responsible for generating both the content and the qualitative nature (qualia) of experience. Although the integration of GWT/GNWT and PP has been explored in other contexts (e.g., [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021], with the latter providing a formal neurocomputational model of such integration), EPET utilizes this synthesis to develop a **specific philosophical theory of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the *embodied* predictive modeling process made globally available (as detailed in Section 4), rather than treating qualia merely as a byproduct of global availability itself. This specific proposal—that qualia are constitutively identical to the intrinsic properties of an embodied, globally accessible predictive model—represents a core philosophical contribution of EPET, aiming to naturalize phenomenal experience within this integrated framework. Furthermore, EPET’s explicit incorporation of **embodiment and interoception** (via PP) [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] provides a richer account of affective experience and the active, predictive nature of consciousness. Crucially, its leveraging of **Buddhist conceptual constraints (such as the principle of Anattā guiding its model of the self)** offers a distinct philosophical grounding not typically found in standard GWT/GNWT accounts. Thus, EPET's engagement with GWT/GNWT is not merely additive but involves a **deep philosophical reinterpretation** of how global access contributes to a fully embodied and subjectively rich conscious experience, framed within its unique emergentist and Buddhist-informed perspective.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET deeply embeds **Predictive Processing (PP)**, including its formulations as Predictive Coding (PC) or under the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013], as the **primary neurocomputational mechanism** for perception, action, attention (via precision weighting), interoception, and for generating the content and qualitative character of conscious experience. Many of EPET's specific explanations, such as its account of qualia (Section 4) and the phenomenal self-model (Section 3.2), are built upon the architectural and dynamic principles of PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While PP offers a powerful and unifying account of brain function, and recent analyses suggest that a minimal theory of consciousness might be implicit in Active Inference itself by focusing on hierarchical self-models [@WhyteEtAl2024], theories relying solely on PP can face challenges in robustly explaining the transition from non-conscious processing to full-blown conscious awareness, the global integration of information, and the subjective unity of experience [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020]. EPET addresses these aspects by **supplementing PP with the Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing that **global availability** of PP-generated content (or significant prediction errors) is a necessary condition for conscious access and integration.
    Beyond this structural addition, and while the general idea of integrating PP and GWT is also being explored by others (e.g., [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021]), EPET offers a **distinctive philosophical interpretation and application** of this synthesis. This interpretation is primarily characterized by: (1) its consistent **non-reductive emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999] for understanding how qualia arise as real, intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive process; and (2) its active utilization of **key Buddhist philosophical concepts**—such as Anattā (no-self) to provide conceptual constraints for its model of selfhood, and Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) to reinforce its processual and relational ontology—as guiding principles and heuristic tools. This philosophical superstructure, by explicitly addressing the *ontological status* of emergent qualia and the *constructed nature* of the self, allows EPET to move beyond purely functional or computational accounts often associated with PP. It aims to explain not just *how* predictive mechanisms operate, but *what it is like* to be a system governed by such mechanisms and *how* a coherent sense of self can arise without a central, substantial entity.

Furthermore, EPET's integrative nature, particularly its emphasis on embodiment and GWT, offers potential responses to common criticisms leveled against PP-only theories, such as the "dark room problem" (i.e., why don't prediction-minimizing agents simply find a dark, quiet room and stay there?). While pure PP might struggle to provide a complete answer, EPET addresses this by integrating several factors:

1.  **Embodiment and Active Inference:** EPET emphasizes that prediction error minimization occurs over the long term for an embodied agent actively engaging with its environment to satisfy its homeostatic and allostatic needs. Staying in a dark room fails to minimize prediction errors related to physiological imperatives (signaled via interoception) and long-term survival goals, which are themselves part of the generative model. Active inference thus compels the agent to explore and gather information to refine its models and fulfill its organismic needs [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013].
    
2.  **Global Workspace Access (GWT):** The capacity for flexible, goal-directed behavior, crucial for survival, requires globally available information for higher cognitive functions (such as planning, complex decision-making, and metacognition), facilitated by GWT. This prevents the system from settling into a state of minimal exteroceptive sensory input if that state conflicts with broader, internally generated goals accessible and maintained through the workspace [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993].
    
3.  **Innate Priors and Evolutionary Goals:** The brain's generative models are not constructed *de novo* but are deeply shaped by evolutionary and developmental priors reflecting fundamental biological imperatives (e.g., survival, reproduction, social affiliation). These innate priors inherently counteract overly simplistic error minimization strategies like the dark room scenario by biasing the system towards actions and states conducive to long-term viability.
    
It is this **synergistic integration** of embodied active inference, global access mechanisms, and biologically plausible priors within the PP framework that allows EPET to provide a more robust and ecologically valid account of adaptive behavior compared to PP considered in isolation.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Recent Integrative Approaches (e.g., IWMT, MUM, Thoughtseed)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** The pursuit of integrative theories of consciousness has recently seen other notable contributions, particularly those leveraging the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Predictive Processing. For instance, Safron's Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020; @safronIntegratedWorldModeling2022] proposes a comprehensive synthesis that includes not only FEP/PP and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) but also aims to incorporate aspects of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Attention Schema Theory. Similarly, the Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) outlined by Ramstead et al. [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] seeks to distill a common core from various FEP-based models of consciousness, focusing on features like hierarchical inference, global availability, and self-modeling, often with a more formal or abstract emphasis. More recently, the Thoughtseed Framework by Kavi et al. [@KaviEtAl2024] offers another hierarchical model combining active inference, global workspace ideas, and embodiment from a neuro-evolutionary perspective.

    While EPET shares the integrative spirit and some foundational components (PP, GWT) with these approaches, it distinguishes itself through several key aspects of its **philosophical architecture, conceptual focus, and explanatory aims**:

    1.  **Specific Metaphysical Grounding and Scope:** EPET is explicitly and consistently grounded in **non-reductive (weak) emergentist physicalism**. Unlike IWMT, which attempts to integrate IIT (with its potential panpsychist implications and computational challenges concerning Φ, such as the non-uniqueness problem highlighted by [@hanson2021nonuniqueness]), EPET deliberately avoids IIT to maintain its emergentist stance and focus on dynamic processes rather than static informational measures. While emergentist reinterpretations of IIT have been proposed [@Negro2022], EPET argues that a more direct emergentist account based on PP-GWT dynamics is preferable, avoiding the specific axiomatic and mathematical commitments of IIT altogether. EPET's scope is primarily a **philosophical theory** aimed at explaining the *nature and emergence* of phenomenal experience (qualia) and the self, rather than providing an exhaustive formal model of all cognitive architecture.

    2.  **Constitutive Explanation of Qualia and Self:** A core differentiator is EPET's specific proposal for a **constitutive explanation of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the integrated, *embodied* predictive modeling process (Section 4). It also offers a detailed account of the **phenomenal self as a dynamic self-model** emerging from recursive Predictive Processing, an account explicitly constrained by and aligned with the Buddhist principle of *Anattā* (no-self). While IWMT, MUM, and Thoughtseed also address self-modeling, EPET’s integration with embodiment for affect and its specific philosophical framing of the self (and its dissolution), guided by the *Anattā* principle, offer a distinct perspective that emphasizes the radically processual and non-essential nature of selfhood, potentially differing from accounts that might implicitly retain a more unified or observer-like self-construct.

    3.  **Explicit Use of Buddhist Conceptual Constraints:** EPET uniquely employs select insights from Buddhist philosophy not merely as analogies but as **active conceptual constraints and heuristic tools**. The principle of **Anattā (no-self)**, as introduced in Section 1.3, directly shapes its model of the self, a strategy that finds resonance in contemporary analyses linking Buddhist thought with active inference and self-modeling (e.g., [@deane2020losing; @zhang2024beyond]). Furthermore, the **processual and relational ontology** emphasized in Buddhist thought (which understands phenomena as impermanent and dependently arisen) reinforces EPET's dynamic, emergentist view of consciousness, aligning with its rejection of static or substantial mental entities. This integration provides a unique philosophical depth and direction to the theory.

    4.  **Clarity and Focus of Core Components:** EPET deliberately chooses a **more focused set of core mechanistic components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment) and frames them within this specific philosophical structure. This focus, combined with its emergentist and Buddhist-informed constraints, aims for greater **conceptual clarity and specificity** in its explanations of qualia and selfhood, and in generating testable hypotheses related to these phenomena. This contrasts with potentially more abstract or broader integrative models that, while covering a wider range of theories or formalisms, may offer less direct engagement with the core philosophical puzzles of subjective experience.

    In summary, while acknowledging valuable overlaps with other FEP-based integrative efforts, EPET's distinctive contribution lies in its **particular philosophical synthesis**: a non-reductive emergentist account of embodied predictive experience, conceptually guided by specific Buddhist insights like **Anattā and a process-oriented worldview**, aimed at providing a coherent and naturalistic explanation for the subjective quality of experience and the constructed nature of the self. It is this particular constellation of a focused mechanistic core (PP-GWT-Embodiment), a consistent emergentist metaphysics, and guiding Buddhist-inspired conceptual constraints that defines EPET's unique contribution to the ongoing interdisciplinary effort to understand consciousness.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

While both EPET and IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] emphasize information integration, they differ fundamentally. IIT relies on a static mathematical measure (Φ) often leading to panpsychist implications and facing computational challenges [@hanson2021nonuniqueness]. EPET, grounded in emergentist physicalism, views integration as a dynamic neurocomputational process (PP-GWT), avoiding panpsychism and aligning better with the processual nature of experience and biological mechanisms. EPET offers a mechanistic, emergentist account without invoking IIT's specific formalism or axioms [@Negro2022]. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B.1 for extended discussion).
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR)

EPET contrasts with Higher-Order Theories [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023] by being primarily **first-order** regarding basic qualia. Phenomenality arises directly from the integrated predictive process (PP-GWT), without requiring a separate higher-order state targeting it, thus avoiding common HOR issues (e.g., infinite regress). While EPET's self-model enables meta-representation for self-awareness [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004], this is distinct from the generation of basic phenomenal experience. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B.2 for details on HOR challenges and EPET's self-model role).


## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

EPET shares functionalism's emphasis on process and functional roles [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013]. However, it diverges from 'pure' functionalism, which abstracts away from physical implementation and thus struggles with qualia [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET maintains that the **specifics of physical realization**—particularly the dynamics of an integrated, *embodied* predictive process in a living system—are **constitutive of qualia** (Section 4), offering a more grounded account of phenomenal character than implementation-neutral functionalism [@Wiese2024]. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B.3 for further discussion).


## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

Strong illusionism denies or radically reinterprets phenomenal consciousness (qualia) as a cognitive illusion [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016; @carruthersStopCaringConsciousness2020]. EPET **rejects such eliminativism**, affirming subjective experience as a real, emergent physical process requiring explanation (Section 4). While acknowledging our *conceptualizations* of qualia or the self might be partly mistaken (resonating with *Anattā* or critiques of folk psychology), EPET maintains the reality of the underlying phenomenal experience itself, aligning with critiques of strong illusionism [@balog2020disillusioned; @chalmers2020meta]. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B.4 for a detailed discussion).


## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

In contrast to panpsychism, which posits consciousness as a fundamental feature of reality [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017], EPET's **emergentist** stance holds that consciousness arises as a novel process only in systems with specific organizational complexity (integrated, embodied predictive modeling). This avoids panpsychism's notorious **combination problem** (how micro-experiences combine) and aligns better with empirical evidence suggesting consciousness is tied to complex biological systems [@gaetanolicataPanpsychismEmergentismMindbody2024; @yurchenko2024panpsychism]. EPET offers a more parsimonious and empirically testable account than attributing consciousness fundamentally to matter. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B.5 for further discussion).


## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET within the Theoretical Landscape

EPET positions itself as an integrative, non-reductive physicalist framework aiming for philosophical coherence, empirical plausibility, and explanatory power regarding core problems like qualia and the self, while avoiding problematic metaphysical extremes.

Its key distinctions include:
*   **vs. Pure PP/GWT:** EPET integrates PP (for content/qualia generation) and GWT (for access/unity), enriching both through embodiment and a specific emergentist philosophy (Sec 6.1, 6.2).
*   **vs. Formal PP+GWT Models (e.g., PGNW [@whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021]):** While sharing the core mechanistic integration, EPET provides a broader philosophical interpretation concerning emergence, qualia constitution, embodiment, and the nature of the self.
*   **vs. IIT:** EPET offers a dynamic, process-based emergentist account without IIT's static formalism, computational challenges, or panpsychist implications (Sec 6.4).
*   **vs. Illusionism/Panpsychism:** EPET affirms the reality of qualia as emergent properties, rejecting both eliminativism and the fundamental nature of consciousness posited by panpsychism (Sec 6.7, 6.8).
*   **vs. HOR:** EPET explains basic qualia at a first-order level, reserving higher-order functions for self-awareness via its self-model (Sec 6.5).
*   **vs. Other Integrative Theories (IWMT, MUM, Thoughtseed):** EPET is distinguished by its **specific philosophical architecture**: a consistent non-reductive emergentism, a constitutive account of qualia, and unique **conceptual constraints from Buddhist philosophy** (esp. *Anattā* for the self-model, process ontology) guiding its synthesis of PP, GWT, and embodiment [@deane2020losing; @zhang2024beyond]. This focus allows for particular clarity on qualia and selfhood and generates specific hypotheses (Sec 6.3). EPET also emphasizes the importance of physical realization over pure computation [@Wiese2024]. Its unique synthesis allows EPET to offer potentially more parsimonious or unified explanations for certain empirical phenomena, such as psychedelic ego dissolution or the dynamic interplay between interoceptive states and conscious access, compared to less integrated frameworks (see Supplementary Materials E for examples). For instance, its unique integration of an *Anattā*-constrained self-model with PP and GWT leads to the specific prediction that experimentally induced 'ego dissolution' should selectively alter the global workspace integration of self-related information while potentially enhancing the phenomenal clarity of non-self stimuli (Prediction 3, see Supplementary Materials C), a hypothesis not readily derived from frameworks lacking these specific philosophical commitments.

EPET thus navigates a path between competing theories, offering a coherent alternative grounded in science and philosophy, aiming for explanatory adequacy and empirical testability within the evolving landscape of consciousness research [@sethTheoriesConsciousness2022; @sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025]. (See Supplementary Materials, Section B for extended comparisons).
