# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other prominent theories of consciousness highlights its distinctive philosophical positioning and explanatory strengths. EPET is proposed as an integrative, non-reductive physicalist framework, which uniquely synthesizes mechanisms from Predictive Processing and Global Workspace Theory through an emergentist lens; a synthesis that is further conceptually enriched and constrained by select insights from Buddhist philosophy.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] core mechanism of global availability, as elaborated in its neural form (GNWT) by Dehaene and colleagues [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], to explain **conscious access**, the integration of information, and the unity of experience.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While GWT/GNWT primarily focuses on the mechanisms of conscious access and broadcast, it offers a less detailed account of how the specific content and qualitative character of conscious states are generated. EPET **supplements GWT/GNWT** by incorporating **Predictive Processing (PP)** [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the fundamental mechanism responsible for generating both the content and the qualitative nature (qualia) of experience. Although the integration of GWT/GNWT and PP has been explored in other contexts (e.g., [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021]), EPET utilizes this synthesis to develop a **specific philosophical theory of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the *embodied* predictive modeling process made globally available (as detailed in Section 4), rather than treating qualia merely as a byproduct of global availability itself. Furthermore, EPET’s explicit incorporation of **embodiment and interoception** (via PP) [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] provides a richer account of affective experience and the active, predictive nature of consciousness. Crucially, its leveraging of **Buddhist conceptual constraints (such as the principle of Anattā guiding its model of the self)** offers a distinct philosophical grounding not typically found in standard GWT/GNWT accounts.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET deeply embeds **Predictive Processing (PP)**, including its formulations as Predictive Coding (PC) or under the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013], as the **primary neurocomputational mechanism** for perception, action, attention (via precision weighting), interoception, and for generating the content and qualitative character of conscious experience. Many of EPET's specific explanations, such as its account of qualia (Section 4) and the phenomenal self-model (Section 3.2), are built upon the architectural and dynamic principles of PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While PP offers a powerful and unifying account of brain function, theories relying solely on PP can face challenges in robustly explaining the transition from non-conscious processing to full-blown conscious awareness, the global integration of information, and the subjective unity of experience [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020]. EPET addresses these aspects by **supplementing PP with the Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing that **global availability** of PP-generated content (or significant prediction errors) is a necessary condition for conscious access and integration.
    Beyond this structural addition, and while the general idea of integrating PP and GWT is also being explored by others (e.g., [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021]), EPET offers a **distinctive philosophical interpretation and application** of this synthesis. This interpretation is primarily characterized by: (1) its consistent **non-reductive emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999] for understanding how qualia arise as real, intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive process; and (2) its active utilization of **key Buddhist philosophical concepts**—such as Anattā (no-self) to provide conceptual constraints for its model of selfhood, and Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) to reinforce its processual and relational ontology—as guiding principles and heuristic tools. **This philosophical superstructure allows EPET to address not only the mechanisms of prediction and access but also the fundamental nature of subjective experience and selfhood in a way that many PP-focused accounts, primarily concerned with cognitive function, do not explicitly tackle.**

Furthermore, EPET's integrative nature, particularly its emphasis on embodiment and GWT, offers potential responses to common criticisms leveled against PP-only theories, such as the "dark room problem" (i.e., why don't prediction-minimizing agents simply find a dark, quiet room and stay there?). While pure PP might struggle to provide a complete answer, EPET addresses this by integrating several factors:

1.  **Embodiment and Active Inference:** EPET emphasizes that prediction error minimization occurs over the long term for an embodied agent actively engaging with its environment to satisfy its homeostatic and allostatic needs. Staying in a dark room fails to minimize prediction errors related to physiological imperatives (signaled via interoception) and long-term survival goals, which are themselves part of the generative model. Active inference thus compels the agent to explore and gather information to refine its models and fulfill its organismic needs [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013].
    
2.  **Global Workspace Access (GWT):** The capacity for flexible, goal-directed behavior, crucial for survival, requires globally available information for higher cognitive functions (such as planning, complex decision-making, and metacognition), facilitated by GWT. This prevents the system from settling into a state of minimal exteroceptive sensory input if that state conflicts with broader, internally generated goals accessible and maintained through the workspace [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993].
    
3.  **Innate Priors and Evolutionary Goals:** The brain's generative models are not constructed *de novo* but are deeply shaped by evolutionary and developmental priors reflecting fundamental biological imperatives (e.g., survival, reproduction, social affiliation). These innate priors inherently counteract overly simplistic error minimization strategies like the dark room scenario by biasing the system towards actions and states conducive to long-term viability.
    
By integrating embodied active inference, global access mechanisms, and biologically plausible priors within the PP framework, EPET provides a more robust and ecologically valid account of adaptive behavior compared to PP considered in isolation.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Recent Integrative Approaches (e.g., IWMT, MUM)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** The pursuit of integrative theories of consciousness has recently seen other notable contributions, particularly those leveraging the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Predictive Processing. For instance, Safron's Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020; @safronIntegratedWorldModeling2022] proposes a comprehensive synthesis that includes not only FEP/PP and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) but also aims to incorporate aspects of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Attention Schema Theory. Similarly, the Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) outlined by Ramstead et al. [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] seeks to distill a common core from various FEP-based models of consciousness, focusing on features like hierarchical inference, global availability, and self-modeling, often with a more formal or abstract emphasis.

    While EPET shares the integrative spirit and some foundational components (PP, GWT) with these approaches, it distinguishes itself through several key aspects of its **philosophical architecture, conceptual focus, and explanatory aims**:

    1.  **Specific Metaphysical Grounding and Scope:** EPET is explicitly and consistently grounded in **non-reductive (weak) emergentist physicalism**. Unlike IWMT, which attempts to integrate IIT (with its potential panpsychist implications and computational challenges concerning Φ), EPET deliberately avoids IIT to maintain its emergentist stance and focus on dynamic processes rather than static informational measures. EPET's scope is primarily a **philosophical theory** aimed at explaining the *nature and emergence* of phenomenal experience (qualia) and the self, rather than providing an exhaustive formal model of all cognitive architecture.

    2.  **Constitutive Explanation of Qualia and Self:** A core differentiator is EPET's specific proposal for a **constitutive explanation of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the integrated, *embodied* predictive modeling process (Section 4). It also offers a detailed account of the **phenomenal self as a dynamic self-model** emerging from recursive predictive processing, an account explicitly constrained by and aligned with the Buddhist principle of Anattā (no-self). While IWMT and MUM also address self-modeling, EPET’s integration with embodiment for affect and its specific philosophical framing of the self (and its dissolution) offer a distinct perspective.

    3.  **Explicit Use of Buddhist Conceptual Constraints:** EPET uniquely employs select insights from Buddhist philosophy not merely as analogies but as **active conceptual constraints and heuristic tools**. The principle of **Anattā (no-self)**, as introduced in Section 1.3, directly shapes its model of the self. Furthermore, the **processual and relational ontology** emphasized in Buddhist thought (which understands phenomena as impermanent and dependently arisen) reinforces EPET's dynamic, emergentist view of consciousness, aligning with its rejection of static or substantial mental entities. This integration provides a unique philosophical depth and direction to the theory.

    4.  **Clarity and Focus of Core Components:** EPET deliberately chooses a **more focused set of core mechanistic components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment) and frames them within this specific philosophical structure. This focus, combined with its emergentist and Buddhist-informed constraints, aims for greater **conceptual clarity and specificity** in its explanations of qualia and selfhood, and in generating testable hypotheses related to these phenomena, compared to potentially more abstract or broader integrative models that might encompass a wider array of theories or formalisms.

    In summary, while acknowledging valuable overlaps with other FEP-based integrative efforts, EPET's distinctive contribution lies in its **particular philosophical synthesis**: a non-reductive emergentist account of embodied predictive experience, conceptually guided by specific Buddhist insights like **Anattā and a process-oriented worldview**, aimed at providing a coherent and naturalistic explanation for the subjective quality of experience and the constructed nature of the self.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

-   **Similarities:** Both EPET and IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] recognize the importance of **information integration** for consciousness.
-   **Differences/Advantages:** IIT typically employs a static, mathematical measure of integrated information (Φ), which has led to significant computational challenges and, in some interpretations, to **panpsychist implications** (attributing consciousness to a wide range of systems based on their Φ value). EPET, by contrast, conceptualizes integration as a **dynamic, ongoing process** realized through specific neurocomputational mechanisms (PP, GWT), which allows for a closer connection with cognitive functions and observable brain dynamics. By adhering to **emergentist physicalism**, EPET avoids panpsychism and the associated combination problem. This processual and emergentist view aligns better with a **philosophical understanding of phenomena as dependently arisen and impermanent (a perspective central to Buddhist philosophy, as discussed in Section 1.3, and harmonious with EPET's core tenets)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness (e.g., HOT, HOP)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Higher-Order Theories (HOR) of consciousness, such as Higher-Order Thought (HOT) or Higher-Order Perception (HOP) theories [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023], generally posit that a mental state becomes conscious only when it is the target of a higher-order meta-representational state. EPET, in contrast, is primarily a **first-order theory** concerning basic phenomenal experience: **phenomenal quality (qualia) is considered an intrinsic property of the primary, integrated predictive modeling process itself.** This approach avoids some of the common challenges faced by HOR, such as the problem of a potential infinite regress or the question of how a non-phenomenal meta-representation could itself generate phenomenal quality. Within EPET, **meta-representational abilities** are indeed crucial, but they are linked to the emergence of **self-awareness, introspection, and the phenomenal sense of self** (explained via recursive self-modeling within the PP architecture [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004]), rather than to the generation of basic phenomenality itself.
    

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

-   **Similarities:** EPET shares with many functionalist approaches an emphasis on the **processual nature** of mind and the **functional roles** that conscious states play, such as information integration and guiding flexible behavior [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013].
-   **Differences/Advantages:** However, 'pure' or 'machine-state' functionalism, which defines mental states solely by their causal roles irrespective of their physical implementation, often faces challenges in accounting for the qualitative character of experience (the 'hard problem' of qualia) [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET, while acknowledging the importance of function, argues that the **specifics of the physical realization and the intrinsic organizational and dynamic properties of the underlying emergent, embodied process** are what constitute qualia. It is not just *any* functional architecture that realizes experience, but one characterized by the complex dynamics of integrated predictive modeling within a living system. EPET addresses qualia by identifying them with these specific, high-level properties of this particular kind of process (as detailed in Section 4), thus offering a more grounded account of phenomenal character than typically provided by pure functionalism.


## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness (qualia). EPET **rejects eliminativism**, recognizing subjective experience as the explanandum. EPET aims to **explain experience** as a real property of an emergent process. It agrees that our conceptual understanding or narrative construction of qualia and self might be mistaken or illusory (a view that resonates with the deconstructive aspects of, for example, the Anattā doctrine concerning the self-entity [@dennettQuiningQualia1988]), but EPET affirms the reality of the underlying phenomenal experience itself.
    

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Panpsychism, in its various forms [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017; @chalmersPanpsychismPanprotopsychism2013], posits that consciousness (or proto-consciousness) is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. EPET, in stark contrast, is an **emergentist theory**: consciousness is not fundamental but arises as a novel process only in physical systems that achieve a specific high level of organizational and dynamic complexity (namely, those capable of integrated, embodied predictive modeling). This emergentist stance allows EPET to avoid the significant **combination problem** faced by panpsychism (i.e., how myriad micro-consciousnesses combine to form macro-conscious experience) and aligns better with the current lack of empirical evidence for consciousness in simple physical systems. Furthermore, EPET's emergentism is more consonant with a **philosophical worldview emphasizing the conditioned, processual, and impermanent nature of phenomena (a perspective consistent with Buddhist philosophy and EPET's core tenets) rather than positing universally distributed, fundamental consciousness**.
    

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET within the Theoretical Landscape

EPET’s positioning among alternative theories of consciousness is best understood by evaluating its explanatory and heuristic power, its potential for empirical testability, its approach to central philosophical problems (including the 'hard problem' of qualia and the nature of the self), and its overall philosophical coherence. EPET aims to offer a robust framework by avoiding problematic metaphysical assumptions often associated with other positions.

-   Compared to **pure Predictive Processing (PP) theories**, EPET provides a more complete account of consciousness by explicitly integrating **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** to address mechanisms of conscious accessibility, information integration, and the unity of experience. Furthermore, its emphasis on **embodiment** enriches the PP framework, particularly for understanding affect.
    
-   In contrast to **standard Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT) alone**, which primarily details mechanisms of access, EPET’s incorporation of PP offers a mechanistic and embodied explanation for the **generation of conscious content and its qualitative character (qualia)**.
    
-   Unlike **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, EPET avoids potential computational intractability and panpsychist implications by adhering to a **dynamic, process-based emergentist physicalism** that is more directly amenable to empirical investigation through cognitive and neural dynamics.
    
-   EPET fundamentally differs from **Illusionism** by affirming the reality of phenomenal experience and qualia, offering a naturalistic and **constitutive account** of them as emergent properties, rather than denying their existence or explaining them away as mere cognitive errors.
    
-   By being **emergentist**, EPET also surpasses **Panpsychism**, as it does not posit consciousness as a fundamental property of matter, thereby avoiding the combination problem and aligning better with empirical observations suggesting consciousness is a feature of complex, specifically organized systems.
    
-   Relative to **Higher-Order Theories (HOR)**, EPET explains basic phenomenal consciousness at a **first-order process level** (as intrinsic properties of integrated predictive modeling), thus sidestepping difficulties associated with regress or the generation of qualia by non-phenomenal meta-states, while still accounting for self-awareness through its model of self-modeling.
    
-   Finally, when compared to **other recent integrative approaches (e.g., IWMT, MUM)**, EPET is distinguished by its **specific philosophical architecture and conceptual commitments**. Its novelty lies in the systematic synthesis of PP, GWT, and embodiment within a consistently **non-reductive emergentist physicalist framework**, uniquely guided by **explicit conceptual constraints drawn from Buddhist philosophy** (such as Anattā shaping its model of the self, and a processual ontology reinforcing its dynamic view). This focused philosophical grounding allows EPET to offer particular clarity in its constitutive explanation of qualia and its naturalistic account of selfhood, while generating precise, empirically testable hypotheses regarding these phenomena.

EPET thus offers a philosophically grounded and scientifically informed alternative to competing approaches, navigating a path that avoids the extremes of substance dualism, panpsychism, or strong illusionism. By proposing specific conditions under which its core predictions can be empirically investigated (see Section 8.4), EPET aligns itself with the demands of scientific rigor and aims to contribute to explanatory adequacy within the complex and evolving landscape of consciousness theories (cf. [@sethTheoriesConsciousness2022; @sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025]).
