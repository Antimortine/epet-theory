# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other prominent theories of consciousness highlights its distinctive philosophical positioning and explanatory strengths. EPET is proposed as an integrative, non-reductive physicalist framework, which uniquely synthesizes mechanisms from Predictive Processing and Global Workspace Theory through an emergentist lens; a synthesis that is further conceptually enriched and constrained by select insights from Buddhist philosophy.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] core mechanism of global availability, as elaborated in its neural form (GNWT) by Dehaene and colleagues [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], to explain **conscious access**, the integration of information, and the unity of experience.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While GWT/GNWT primarily focuses on the mechanisms of conscious access and broadcast, it offers a less detailed account of how the specific content and qualitative character of conscious states are generated. EPET **supplements GWT/GNWT** by incorporating **Predictive Processing (PP)** [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the fundamental mechanism responsible for generating both the content and the qualitative nature (qualia) of experience. Although the integration of GWT/GNWT and PP has been explored in other contexts (e.g., [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021], with the latter providing a formal neurocomputational model of such integration), EPET utilizes this synthesis to develop a **specific philosophical theory of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the *embodied* predictive modeling process made globally available (as detailed in Section 4), rather than treating qualia merely as a byproduct of global availability itself. This specific proposal—that qualia are constitutively identical to the intrinsic properties of an embodied, globally accessible predictive model—represents a core philosophical contribution of EPET, aiming to naturalize phenomenal experience within this integrated framework. Furthermore, EPET’s explicit incorporation of **embodiment and interoception** (via PP) [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] provides a richer account of affective experience and the active, predictive nature of consciousness. Crucially, its leveraging of **Buddhist conceptual constraints (such as the principle of Anattā guiding its model of the self)** offers a distinct philosophical grounding not typically found in standard GWT/GNWT accounts. Thus, EPET's engagement with GWT/GNWT is not merely additive but involves a **deep philosophical reinterpretation** of how global access contributes to a fully embodied and subjectively rich conscious experience, framed within its unique emergentist and Buddhist-informed perspective.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET deeply embeds **Predictive Processing (PP)**, including its formulations as Predictive Coding (PC) or under the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013], as the **primary neurocomputational mechanism** for perception, action, attention (via precision weighting), interoception, and for generating the content and qualitative character of conscious experience. Many of EPET's specific explanations, such as its account of qualia (Section 4) and the phenomenal self-model (Section 3.2), are built upon the architectural and dynamic principles of PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** While PP offers a powerful and unifying account of brain function, and recent analyses suggest that a minimal theory of consciousness might be implicit in Active Inference itself by focusing on hierarchical self-models [@WhyteEtAl2024], theories relying solely on PP can face challenges in robustly explaining the transition from non-conscious processing to full-blown conscious awareness, the global integration of information, and the subjective unity of experience [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020]. EPET addresses these aspects by **supplementing PP with the Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing that **global availability** of PP-generated content (or significant prediction errors) is a necessary condition for conscious access and integration.
    Beyond this structural addition, and while the general idea of integrating PP and GWT is also being explored by others (e.g., [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021]), EPET offers a **distinctive philosophical interpretation and application** of this synthesis. This interpretation is primarily characterized by: (1) its consistent **non-reductive emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999] for understanding how qualia arise as real, intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive process; and (2) its active utilization of **key Buddhist philosophical concepts**—such as Anattā (no-self) to provide conceptual constraints for its model of selfhood, and Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) to reinforce its processual and relational ontology—as guiding principles and heuristic tools. This philosophical superstructure, by explicitly addressing the *ontological status* of emergent qualia and the *constructed nature* of the self, allows EPET to move beyond purely functional or computational accounts often associated with PP. It aims to explain not just *how* predictive mechanisms operate, but *what it is like* to be a system governed by such mechanisms and *how* a coherent sense of self can arise without a central, substantial entity.

Furthermore, EPET's integrative nature, particularly its emphasis on embodiment and GWT, offers potential responses to common criticisms leveled against PP-only theories, such as the "dark room problem" (i.e., why don't prediction-minimizing agents simply find a dark, quiet room and stay there?). While pure PP might struggle to provide a complete answer, EPET addresses this by integrating several factors:

1.  **Embodiment and Active Inference:** EPET emphasizes that prediction error minimization occurs over the long term for an embodied agent actively engaging with its environment to satisfy its homeostatic and allostatic needs. Staying in a dark room fails to minimize prediction errors related to physiological imperatives (signaled via interoception) and long-term survival goals, which are themselves part of the generative model. Active inference thus compels the agent to explore and gather information to refine its models and fulfill its organismic needs [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013].
    
2.  **Global Workspace Access (GWT):** The capacity for flexible, goal-directed behavior, crucial for survival, requires globally available information for higher cognitive functions (such as planning, complex decision-making, and metacognition), facilitated by GWT. This prevents the system from settling into a state of minimal exteroceptive sensory input if that state conflicts with broader, internally generated goals accessible and maintained through the workspace [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993].
    
3.  **Innate Priors and Evolutionary Goals:** The brain's generative models are not constructed *de novo* but are deeply shaped by evolutionary and developmental priors reflecting fundamental biological imperatives (e.g., survival, reproduction, social affiliation). These innate priors inherently counteract overly simplistic error minimization strategies like the dark room scenario by biasing the system towards actions and states conducive to long-term viability.
    
It is this **synergistic integration** of embodied active inference, global access mechanisms, and biologically plausible priors within the PP framework that allows EPET to provide a more robust and ecologically valid account of adaptive behavior compared to PP considered in isolation.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Recent Integrative Approaches (e.g., IWMT, MUM, Thoughtseed)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** The pursuit of integrative theories of consciousness has recently seen other notable contributions, particularly those leveraging the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Predictive Processing. For instance, Safron's Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020; @safronIntegratedWorldModeling2022] proposes a comprehensive synthesis that includes not only FEP/PP and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) but also aims to incorporate aspects of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Attention Schema Theory. Similarly, the Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) outlined by Ramstead et al. [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] seeks to distill a common core from various FEP-based models of consciousness, focusing on features like hierarchical inference, global availability, and self-modeling, often with a more formal or abstract emphasis. More recently, the Thoughtseed Framework by Kavi et al. [@KaviEtAl2024] offers another hierarchical model combining active inference, global workspace ideas, and embodiment from a neuro-evolutionary perspective.

    While EPET shares the integrative spirit and some foundational components (PP, GWT) with these approaches, it distinguishes itself through several key aspects of its **philosophical architecture, conceptual focus, and explanatory aims**:

    1.  **Specific Metaphysical Grounding and Scope:** EPET is explicitly and consistently grounded in **non-reductive (weak) emergentist physicalism**. Unlike IWMT, which attempts to integrate IIT (with its potential panpsychist implications and computational challenges concerning Φ, such as the non-uniqueness problem highlighted by [@hanson2021nonuniqueness]), EPET deliberately avoids IIT to maintain its emergentist stance and focus on dynamic processes rather than static informational measures. While emergentist reinterpretations of IIT have been proposed [@Negro2022], EPET argues that a more direct emergentist account based on PP-GWT dynamics is preferable, avoiding the specific axiomatic and mathematical commitments of IIT altogether. EPET's scope is primarily a **philosophical theory** aimed at explaining the *nature and emergence* of phenomenal experience (qualia) and the self, rather than providing an exhaustive formal model of all cognitive architecture.

    2.  **Constitutive Explanation of Qualia and Self:** A core differentiator is EPET's specific proposal for a **constitutive explanation of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the integrated, *embodied* predictive modeling process (Section 4). It also offers a detailed account of the **phenomenal self as a dynamic self-model** emerging from recursive predictive processing, an account explicitly constrained by and aligned with the Buddhist principle of Anattā (no-self). While IWMT, MUM, and Thoughtseed also address self-modeling, EPET’s integration with embodiment for affect and its specific philosophical framing of the self (and its dissolution), guided by the Anattā principle, offer a distinct perspective that emphasizes the radically processual and non-essential nature of selfhood, potentially differing from accounts that might implicitly retain a more unified or observer-like self-construct.

    3.  **Explicit Use of Buddhist Conceptual Constraints:** EPET uniquely employs select insights from Buddhist philosophy not merely as analogies but as **active conceptual constraints and heuristic tools**. The principle of **Anattā (no-self)**, as introduced in Section 1.3, directly shapes its model of the self, a strategy that finds resonance in contemporary analyses linking Buddhist thought with active inference and self-modeling (e.g., [@deane2020losing; @zhang2024beyond]). Furthermore, the **processual and relational ontology** emphasized in Buddhist thought (which understands phenomena as impermanent and dependently arisen) reinforces EPET's dynamic, emergentist view of consciousness, aligning with its rejection of static or substantial mental entities. This integration provides a unique philosophical depth and direction to the theory.

    4.  **Clarity and Focus of Core Components:** EPET deliberately chooses a **more focused set of core mechanistic components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment) and frames them within this specific philosophical structure. This focus, combined with its emergentist and Buddhist-informed constraints, aims for greater **conceptual clarity and specificity** in its explanations of qualia and selfhood, and in generating testable hypotheses related to these phenomena. This contrasts with potentially more abstract or broader integrative models that, while covering a wider range of theories or formalisms, may offer less direct engagement with the core philosophical puzzles of subjective experience.

    In summary, while acknowledging valuable overlaps with other FEP-based integrative efforts, EPET's distinctive contribution lies in its **particular philosophical synthesis**: a non-reductive emergentist account of embodied predictive experience, conceptually guided by specific Buddhist insights like **Anattā and a process-oriented worldview**, aimed at providing a coherent and naturalistic explanation for the subjective quality of experience and the constructed nature of the self. It is this particular constellation of a focused mechanistic core (PP-GWT-Embodiment), a consistent emergentist metaphysics, and guiding Buddhist-inspired conceptual constraints that defines EPET's unique contribution to the ongoing interdisciplinary effort to understand consciousness.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

-   **Similarities:** Both EPET and IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] recognize the importance of **information integration** for consciousness.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** IIT typically employs a static, mathematical measure of integrated information (Φ), which has led to significant computational challenges (e.g., the non-uniqueness of Φ values, as highlighted by [@hanson2021nonuniqueness]) and, in some interpretations, to **panpsychist implications** (attributing consciousness to a wide range of systems based on their Φ value). EPET, by contrast, conceptualizes integration as a **dynamic, ongoing process** realized through specific neurocomputational mechanisms (PP, GWT), which allows for a closer connection with cognitive functions and observable brain dynamics. This emphasis on **dynamic, moment-to-moment processing** aligns more closely with the fluid, ever-changing nature of conscious experience itself, as highlighted by both introspective accounts and process-oriented philosophies (including Buddhist thought). By adhering to **emergentist physicalism**, EPET avoids panpsychism and the associated combination problem. While some recent interpretations attempt to reconcile IIT with emergentism by focusing on the emergence of integrated causal power from a physical substrate [@Negro2022], EPET argues that its own framework, which directly models consciousness as an emergent *process* arising from PP-GWT dynamics, offers a more parsimonious and less axiomatically constrained path to a naturalistic, emergentist theory of consciousness, without relying on the specific mathematical formalism and postulates of IIT. This processual and emergentist view also aligns better with a **philosophical understanding of phenomena as dependently arisen and impermanent (a perspective central to Buddhist philosophy, as discussed in Section 1.3, and harmonious with EPET's core tenets)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness (e.g., HOT, HOP)

Higher-Order Theories (HOR) of consciousness posit that a mental state becomes conscious only when targeted by a higher-order meta-representational state [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023]. EPET contrasts with this by being primarily a **first-order theory** for basic phenomenal experience: qualia are considered intrinsic properties of the integrated predictive modeling process itself (PP-GWT synthesis), sufficient for phenomenal awareness prior to explicit higher-order targeting. This avoids common HOR challenges like potential infinite regress or explaining how non-phenomenal states generate phenomenality. While EPET incorporates meta-representational capacities via its recursive predictive self-model to explain self-awareness and introspection [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004], these are not prerequisites for basic qualia.
    

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

While sharing with functionalism an emphasis on the processual nature of mind and the functional roles of conscious states [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013], EPET diverges from 'pure' or 'machine-state' functionalism, which often struggles to account for qualia irrespective of physical implementation [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET argues that the **specifics of physical realization**—particularly the dynamics of an integrated, *embodied* predictive modeling process within a living system—are constitutive of qualia (Section 4). This insistence on the importance of the realization base, supported by arguments that mere computational simulation may not suffice for consciousness without specific causal and organizational properties [@Wiese2024], allows EPET to offer a more grounded, non-arbitrary account of phenomenal character.


## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

Strong illusionism (e.g., [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016; @carruthersStopCaringConsciousness2020]) denies or radically reinterprets phenomenal consciousness (qualia) as a cognitive illusion. EPET **rejects such eliminativism**, treating subjective experience as a genuine explanandum to be explained as real, intrinsic properties of an emergent physical process (Section 4). While EPET acknowledges that our *conceptualizations* of qualia or the self might be partly mistaken (resonating with Anattā or critiques of folk psychology [@dennettQuiningQualia1988]), it affirms the reality of the underlying phenomenal experience itself, aligning with contemporary critiques of strong illusionism [@balog2020disillusioned; @chalmers2020meta].
    

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017] posits consciousness as a fundamental, ubiquitous feature of reality. EPET, as an **emergentist theory**, contrasts sharply: consciousness is not fundamental but arises as a novel process only in physical systems achieving specific organizational complexity (integrated, embodied predictive modeling). This allows EPET to avoid panpsychism's **combination problem** and aligns better with the lack of empirical evidence for consciousness in simple systems, offering a more empirically testable and parsimonious account (cf. [@gaetanolicataPanpsychismEmergentismMindbody2024; @yurchenko2024panpsychism]). EPET's emergentism, emphasizing the conditioned and processual nature of phenomena, also resonates more with Buddhist-informed ontology than with positing universally distributed, fundamental consciousness, and is akin to "bioprotopsychist" views linking consciousness to life and predictive organization [@yurchenko2024panpsychism].
    

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET within the Theoretical Landscape

EPET’s positioning among alternative theories of consciousness is best understood by evaluating its explanatory and heuristic power, its potential for empirical testability, its approach to central philosophical problems (including the 'hard problem' of qualia and the nature of the self), and its overall philosophical coherence. EPET aims to offer a robust framework by avoiding problematic metaphysical assumptions often associated with other positions.

-   Compared to **pure Predictive Processing (PP) theories**, EPET provides a more complete account of consciousness by explicitly integrating **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** to address mechanisms of conscious accessibility, information integration, and the unity of experience. Furthermore, its emphasis on **embodiment** enriches the PP framework, particularly for understanding affect, and its specific philosophical commitments (emergentism, constitutive qualia) offer a deeper engagement with the nature of subjective experience than purely computational PP models might provide (see Section 6.2).

-   In contrast to **standard Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT) alone**, which primarily details mechanisms of access, EPET’s incorporation of PP offers a mechanistic and embodied explanation for the **generation of conscious content and its qualitative character (qualia)**. EPET thus moves beyond functional access to address the phenomenal nature of experience itself, a philosophical depth not always central to GWT/GNWT (see Section 6.1).

-   Unlike **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, EPET avoids potential computational intractability (e.g., the non-uniqueness of Φ [@hanson2021nonuniqueness]) and problematic panpsychist implications by adhering to a **dynamic, process-based emergentist physicalism**. This makes EPET more directly amenable to empirical investigation through cognitive and neural dynamics and aligns it with a naturalistic worldview that does not require consciousness to be a fundamental feature of all matter (see Section 6.4). Even emergentist interpretations of IIT [@Negro2022] retain a formal machinery that EPET deems unnecessary for its more direct processual account.

-   EPET fundamentally differs from **Illusionism** (e.g., [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016; @carruthersStopCaringConsciousness2020]) by affirming the reality of phenomenal experience and qualia. It offers a naturalistic and **constitutive account** of them as emergent properties of specific physical processes, rather than denying their existence or explaining them away as mere cognitive errors or mischaracterizations (see Section 6.7 and contemporary critiques like [@balog2020disillusioned; @chalmers2020meta]).

-   By being **emergentist**, EPET also surpasses **Panpsychism** (e.g., [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017]), as it does not posit consciousness as a fundamental property of matter. This allows EPET to avoid the intractable combination problem and aligns better with empirical observations suggesting consciousness is a feature of complex, specifically organized systems, rather than a ubiquitous property (see Section 6.8 and critiques like [@gaetanolicataPanpsychismEmergentismMindbody2024; @yurchenko2024panpsychism]).

-   Relative to **Higher-Order Theories (HOR)** [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023], EPET explains basic phenomenal consciousness at a **first-order process level** (as intrinsic properties of integrated predictive modeling), thus sidestepping difficulties associated with regress or the generation of qualia by non-phenomenal meta-states. While EPET incorporates meta-representational capacities via its recursive self-model to explain self-awareness and introspection, these are not prerequisites for basic phenomenality (see Section 6.5).

-   Finally, when compared to **other recent integrative approaches (e.g., IWMT [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020; @safronIntegratedWorldModeling2022], MUM [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023], Thoughtseed Framework [@KaviEtAl2024])**, EPET is distinguished by its **specific philosophical architecture and conceptual commitments**. Its novelty lies in the systematic synthesis of PP, GWT, and embodiment within a consistently **non-reductive emergentist physicalist framework**, uniquely guided by **explicit conceptual constraints drawn from Buddhist philosophy** (such as Anattā shaping its model of the self, and a processual ontology reinforcing its dynamic view, supported by contemporary analyses like [@deane2020losing; @zhang2024beyond]). This focused philosophical grounding allows EPET to offer particular clarity in its constitutive explanation of qualia and its naturalistic account of selfhood, while generating precise, empirically testable hypotheses regarding these phenomena (see Section 6.3). EPET also maintains a critical stance on purely computational sufficiency for consciousness, aligning with arguments that emphasize the importance of specific physical realization and causal flows (cf. [@Wiese2024]).

EPET thus offers a philosophically grounded and scientifically informed alternative to competing approaches, navigating a path that avoids the extremes of substance dualism, panpsychism, or strong illusionism. By proposing specific conditions under which its core predictions can be empirically investigated (see Section 8.4), EPET aligns itself with the demands of scientific rigor and aims to contribute to explanatory adequacy within the complex and evolving landscape of consciousness theories (cf. [@sethTheoriesConsciousness2022; @sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025]).
