# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other theories highlights its strengths and positioning. EPET is an integrative, emergentist, first-order theory using PP and GWT within non-reductive physicalism, conceptually enriched by Buddhism.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] global availability mechanism [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014] for **conscious access**, integration, and unity.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** GWT focuses on access mechanisms, less on content generation/quality. EPET **supplements GWT** with **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the mechanism generating content and qualia**. While integrating GWT/PP is explored elsewhere [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET uses this integration for a philosophical theory explaining qualia as properties of the predictive process (Section 4), not just global availability. EPET also explicitly includes **embodiment/interoception** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] (via PP) and emphasizes the **active, predictive** nature of consciousness. EPET uses this integration primarily to build a philosophical theory explaining qualia as intrinsic process properties, explicitly incorporating embodiment and leveraging **Buddhist conceptual constraints (such as the principle of Anattā guiding its model of the self)**.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET uses **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013] as the primary mechanism** for perception, action, attention, interoception, and generating conscious content/quality. Many EPET explanations (qualia, self-model) build on PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** PP-only theories can be criticized for lacking rigor in explaining consciousness [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020] or struggle with the conscious/unconscious boundary and global integration. EPET **supplements PP with GWT** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing **global availability** as necessary for conscious access/integration of PP-generated content. While PP/GWT integration is explored [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET offers a **distinctive philosophical interpretation** of this synthesis. This interpretation is characterized by: (a) a consistent **emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999] for understanding how qualia arise as properties of the process; and (b) the active utilization of **key Buddhist philosophical concepts**—such as Anattā (no-self) to constrain its model of selfhood and Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination) to reinforce its processual ontology—as guiding principles and heuristic tools.
    

Furthermore, EPET's integrative nature offers potential responses to common criticisms leveled against PP-only theories, such as the "dark room problem" (i.e., why don't prediction-minimizing agents simply find a dark, quiet room and stay there?). While pure PP might struggle here, EPET addresses this by integrating several factors:

1.  **Embodiment and Active Inference:** EPET emphasizes that prediction error minimization occurs over the long term for an embodied agent actively engaging with its environment. Staying in a dark room fails to minimize errors related to physiological needs (interoception) and long-term survival goals. Active inference compels the agent to explore and gather information to refine its models and fulfill its needs [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013].
    
2.  **Global Workspace Access (GWT):** The need for flexible, goal-directed behavior requires globally available information for higher cognitive functions (planning, decision-making), facilitated by GWT. This prevents the system from settling into a state of minimal sensory input if that state conflicts with broader goals accessible through the workspace [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993].
    
3.  **Innate Priors and Evolutionary Goals:** The predictive models are not built from scratch but are shaped by evolutionary priors reflecting fundamental biological imperatives (survival, reproduction), which inherently counteract simplistic error minimization strategies like the dark room scenario.  
    By integrating embodied active inference, global access mechanisms, and biologically plausible priors within the PP framework, EPET provides a more robust account of adaptive behavior compared to PP considered in isolation.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Integrative Approaches (IWMT, MUM)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Other FEP-based integrations like IWMT [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] or MUM [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] aim for broader scope (incl. IIT, Attention Schema) using complex constructs. EPET chooses a **more focused set of core components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment) and uniquely frames them within a philosophical structure that explicitly incorporates **insights from Buddhist philosophy** (e.g., regarding the nature of self and the processual character of experience) to build a specific theory explaining qualia and self. EPET's particular blend of **emergentism with these Buddhist-inspired conceptual constraints** distinguishes its metaphysical and explanatory approach.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

-   **Similarities:** Both recognize **information integration** as key.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] uses a static measure (Φ), leading to computational issues and **panpsychist implications**. EPET sees integration as a **dynamic process** via specific mechanisms (PP, GWT), connecting better with cognition/brain dynamics. EPET avoids panpsychism and the combination problem, staying within emergentist physicalism, aligning better with a **process-oriented understanding of conditioned arising (as articulated, for example, in the Buddhist principle of Paṭiccasamuppāda)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR: HOT/HOP)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** HOR [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023] require meta-representation for consciousness. EPET is **first-order**: phenomenal quality (qualia) is a property of the **primary process** (integrated predictive modeling). This avoids HOR problems (regress, quality generation by meta-representation). EPET links **meta-representational abilities** to **self-awareness/introspection/self-sense** (via self-modeling in PP [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004]), not basic phenomenality.
    

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

-   **Similarities:** Shares emphasis on **processual nature** and **functional role** (integration, control) [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013].
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** Pure functionalism struggles with qualia [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET argues that **specifics of physical realization** matter – the **intrinsic properties of the emergent, embodied process** (integrated predictive modeling). EPET addresses qualia by linking them to these process properties (Section 4).
    

## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness (qualia). EPET **rejects eliminativism**, recognizing subjective experience as the explanandum. EPET aims to **explain experience** as a real property of an emergent process. It agrees that our conceptual understanding or narrative construction of qualia and self might be mistaken or illusory (a view that resonates with the deconstructive aspects of, for example, the Anattā doctrine concerning the self-entity [@dennettQuiningQualia1988]), but EPET affirms the reality of the underlying phenomenal experience itself.
    

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017] posits consciousness as fundamental. EPET is **emergentist**: consciousness arises only in complex, specifically organized systems. EPET avoids the **combination problem** and aligns better with the lack of empirical evidence for consciousness in simple systems, as well as with a **worldview emphasizing conditioned arising (such as Paṭiccasamuppāda) rather than universally distributed fundamental consciousness**.
    

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET

EPET’s positioning among alternative consciousness theories demonstrates clear strengths when evaluated by criteria such as explanatory and heuristic power, empirical testability, ability to solve central philosophical problems (including the 'hard problem'), and philosophical coherence without problematic metaphysical assumptions.

Compared to **pure Predictive Processing theories**, EPET fully addresses conscious accessibility and unity via explicit integration with Global Workspace Theory and embodiment. In contrast to **standard Global Workspace Theory alone**, EPET’s integration of Predictive Processing provides a mechanistic and embodied explanation of qualia and subjective content generation.

Unlike **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, EPET avoids computational intractability and panpsychist implications, providing a clear emergentist physicalist framework that explains consciousness dynamically and empirically testably. EPET rejects **illusionism’s** counterintuitive denial of phenomenality, instead providing a naturalistic and constitutive account of qualia consistent with empirical data and phenomenological intuitions.

EPET also surpasses **panpsychism** by resolving the combination problem and avoiding its empirical untestability. Compared to **Higher-Order theories**, EPET explains phenomenal consciousness at a primary process level, thus sidestepping difficulties associated with infinite regress and meta-representation. Finally, relative to **other integrative approaches (IWMT, MUM)**, EPET is distinguished by its explicit philosophical rigor, its generation of precise predictions, its adoption of **clear conceptual constraints (including those drawn from Buddhist philosophy, such as Anattā, which shapes its model of self)**, and its grounding in empirically testable hypotheses.

EPET thus offers a philosophically preferable alternative to competing approaches, avoiding extremes such as dualism, panpsychism, or illusionism, and stating empirical conditions under which its core predictions can be falsified or supported, thus aligning itself clearly with scientific rigor and explanatory adequacy within the complex landscape of current consciousness theories [@sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025].
