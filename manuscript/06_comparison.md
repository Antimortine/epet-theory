# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) requires comparing it with other influential theories and approaches in the contemporary scientific and philosophical landscape. EPET is positioned as an integrative, emergentist, first-order theory of consciousness, utilizing the mechanisms of Predictive Processing (PP) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) within the framework of non-reductive physicalism and conceptually enriched by Buddhist principles. Let's examine its key differences and potential advantages compared to major alternatives, including other attempts to integrate PP and GWT.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

*   **Similarities:** EPET acknowledges the heuristic value of GWT [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] and **integrates** its central mechanism – global availability of information through broadcasting across the brain [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014] – as key for explaining **conscious access**, information integration, and the formation of a unified field of consciousness.
*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** While GWT focuses on the mechanisms of access and broadcasting, it says less about how the content that enters the workspace is generated and why it possesses phenomenal quality. EPET **supplements GWT** by proposing **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the mechanism for generating the content and quality (qualia)** of experience. It should be noted that the idea of integrating GWT with predictive/Bayesian mechanisms is not unique to EPET and is being developed in the work of other authors focusing on computational modeling or solving specific empirical puzzles (see, e.g., @hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021). However, EPET uses this integration to build a philosophical theory explaining qualia as properties of the predictive modeling process (Section 4), rather than merely a result of global availability. Furthermore, EPET explicitly includes **embodiment and the role of interoception** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] (via PP) as fundamental aspects of consciousness, which is less emphasized in standard versions of GWT, and highlights the **active, predictive** nature of consciousness.

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

*   **Similarities:** EPET utilizes **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013] as the primary mechanism** for explaining perception, action, attention, interoception, and the generation of the content and quality of conscious experience. Many of EPET's explanations (e.g., qualia as aspects of modeling, "self" as a self-model) are built upon PP.
*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Theories based solely on PP are sometimes criticized for lacking rigor or empirical grounding when explaining consciousness [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020], and may also struggle with clearly drawing the line between conscious and unconscious processing or explaining global integration. EPET **supplements PP with the GWT mechanism** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing the criterion of **global availability** as a necessary condition for conscious access and integration of content generated by PP. Although the integration of PP and GWT itself is explored by others (see above, and also @auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021), EPET offers a **unique philosophical interpretation** of this synthesis: qualia are explained as properties of the emergent process, PP and GWT are placed within a clear **emergentist metaphysical framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999], and, most importantly, the theory actively uses **Buddhist concepts** (*Anattā*, *Anicca*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*) as inherent constraints and heuristic guides for interpreting PP mechanisms.

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Integrative Approaches (IWMT, MUM)

*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Other ambitious attempts to integrate theories of consciousness exist, often within the Free Energy Principle (FEP) framework, such as the Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] or the Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023]. These approaches aim to encompass an even broader range of theories (including IIT, Attention Schema, etc.) and employ more complex theoretical constructs (e.g., self-organizing harmonic modes, quantum formulations of FEP). EPET, in contrast, chooses a **more focused set of core components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment, Buddhism) and builds upon them a **specific philosophical theory** with concrete explanations for qualia and the "self." EPET's metaphysical foundations (emergentism + Buddhism) also differ from those of these broader frameworks. EPET strives for greater conceptual clarity and a direct connection to the discussed philosophical problems, rather than aiming for the broadest possible, but potentially more abstract, coverage.

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

*   **Similarities:** Both theories recognize **information integration** as a key characteristic of consciousness.
*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] defines consciousness through a static, mathematical measure of integrated information (Φ), which leads to computational difficulties and counterintuitive **panpsychist implications**. EPET understands integration as a **dynamic process**, realized through specific neural mechanisms (PP and GWT), which better connects with cognitive functions and brain dynamics. EPET avoids panpsychism and its associated combination problem, remaining within the framework of emergentist physicalism, which also aligns better with the Buddhist principle of ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR: HOT/HOP)

*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Higher-order theories (HOR) [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023] assert that a state becomes conscious only when there is a meta-representation of that state. EPET is a **first-order theory**: phenomenal quality (qualia) is a property of the **primary process** (integrated predictive modeling), not the result of its meta-representation. This avoids several problems of HOR (e.g., the regress problem, the question of how meta-representation generates quality, the need for complex meta-representations for simple sensations). EPET acknowledges the importance of **meta-representational abilities** but links them to **self-awareness, introspection, and the sense of "self"** (realized through self-modeling in PP [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004]), rather than to the constitution of the basic phenomenality of each conscious moment.

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

*   **Similarities:** EPET shares with functionalism [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013] an emphasis on the **processual nature** and **functional role** of consciousness (information integration, behavioral control).
*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Pure functionalism defines mental states solely through their causal roles, struggling to explain qualia [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET goes beyond this, arguing that for phenomenality, not only the abstract function matters, but also the **specifics of its physical realization** – that is, the **intrinsic properties of the emergent, embodied process** (integrated predictive modeling) that performs this function. EPET directly addresses the problem of qualia by linking them to these properties of the process (Section 4).

## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] radically solves the "hard problem" by denying the reality of phenomenal consciousness (qualia) in its intuitive sense. EPET **rejects this eliminativist stance**, recognizing the reality of subjective experience as the explanandum. Instead of denying experience, EPET aims to **explain it** as a real property of a real emergent process. However, EPET can agree with illusionism that our *intuitive beliefs* or *conceptualizations* about the nature of qualia or the "self" might be mistaken or constructed [@dennettQuiningQualia1988], but this does not negate the reality of the underlying *experience* itself.

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

*   **Differences and Advantages of EPET:** Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017] posits consciousness (or proto-consciousness) as a fundamental property of reality. EPET adheres to **emergentism**: consciousness is a rare property that arises only in systems with very high complexity and specific organization. EPET avoids the main problem of panpsychism – the **combination problem** – and aligns better with the lack of scientific evidence for consciousness in simple systems, as well as with the Buddhist ontology of ***Paṭiccasamuppāda***.

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET

In the landscape of consciousness theories, EPET occupies a unique niche as an **integrative, emergentist, first-order theory**. Although the idea of synthesizing PP and GWT is also developed in other works, EPET is distinguished by its **philosophical focus**, its **specific set of integrated components**, and, crucially, its **deep integration with the conceptual tools of Buddhism**. It offers a naturalistic, yet non-eliminative and non-reductive explanation of **qualia** and the **sense of "self,"** compatible with scientific data and key Buddhist principles, and aims to provide a coherent response amidst existing theoretical disagreements [@sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025]. Avoiding the extremes of dualism, panpsychism, and strong reductionism/illusionism, EPET represents an attempt to construct a well-founded framework for understanding consciousness, open to further development and testing.
