# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other theories highlights its strengths and positioning. EPET is an integrative, emergentist, first-order theory using PP and GWT within non-reductive physicalism, conceptually enriched by Buddhism.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] global availability mechanism [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014] for **conscious access**, integration, and unity.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** GWT focuses on access mechanisms, less on content generation/quality. EPET **supplements GWT** with **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the mechanism generating content and qualia**. While integrating GWT/PP is explored elsewhere [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET uses this integration for a philosophical theory explaining qualia as properties of the predictive process (Section 4), not just global availability. EPET also explicitly includes **embodiment/interoception** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] (via PP) and emphasizes the **active, predictive** nature of consciousness. EPET uses this integration primarily to build a philosophical theory explaining qualia as intrinsic process properties, explicitly incorporating embodiment and Buddhist constraints.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET uses **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013] as the primary mechanism** for perception, action, attention, interoception, and generating conscious content/quality. Many EPET explanations (qualia, self-model) build on PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** PP-only theories can be criticized for lacking rigor in explaining consciousness [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020] or struggle with the conscious/unconscious boundary and global integration. EPET **supplements PP with GWT** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing **global availability** as necessary for conscious access/integration of PP-generated content. While PP/GWT integration is explored [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET offers a **unique philosophical interpretation**: qualia as emergent process properties, PP/GWT within an **emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999], and active use of **Buddhist concepts** (Anattā, Paṭiccasamuppāda) as constraints/guides. EPET offers a unique philosophical interpretation of this synthesis within an emergentist framework explicitly guided by Buddhist principles like Anattā.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Integrative Approaches (IWMT, MUM)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Other FEP-based integrations like IWMT [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] or MUM [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] aim for broader scope (incl. IIT, Attention Schema) using complex constructs. EPET chooses a **more focused set of core components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment, Buddhism) to build a **specific philosophical theory** explaining qualia and self. EPET's metaphysics (emergentism + Buddhism) also differ. EPET aims for conceptual clarity and direct connection to philosophical problems, not maximal abstract coverage.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

-   **Similarities:** Both recognize **information integration** as key.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] uses a static measure (Φ), leading to computational issues and **panpsychist implications**. EPET sees integration as a **dynamic process** via specific mechanisms (PP, GWT), connecting better with cognition/brain dynamics. EPET avoids panpsychism and the combination problem, staying within emergentist physicalism, aligning better with **Paṭiccasamuppāda** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR: HOT/HOP)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** HOR [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023] require meta-representation for consciousness. EPET is **first-order**: phenomenal quality (qualia) is a property of the **primary process** (integrated predictive modeling). This avoids HOR problems (regress, quality generation by meta-representation). EPET links **meta-representational abilities** to **self-awareness/introspection/self-sense** (via self-modeling in PP [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004]), not basic phenomenality.
    

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

-   **Similarities:** Shares emphasis on **processual nature** and **functional role** (integration, control) [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013].
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** Pure functionalism struggles with qualia [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET argues that **specifics of physical realization** matter – the **intrinsic properties of the emergent, embodied process** (integrated predictive modeling). EPET addresses qualia by linking them to these process properties (Section 4).
    

## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness (qualia). EPET **rejects eliminativism**, recognizing subjective experience as the explanandum. EPET aims to **explain experience** as a real property of an emergent process. It agrees that beliefs about qualia/self might be mistaken [@dennettQuiningQualia1988], but not the underlying experience.
    

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017] posits consciousness as fundamental. EPET is **emergentist**: consciousness arises only in complex, specifically organized systems. EPET avoids the **combination problem** and aligns better with lack of evidence for simple system consciousness and **Paṭiccasamuppāda**.
    

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET

EPET’s positioning among alternative consciousness theories demonstrates clear strengths when evaluated by criteria such as explanatory and heuristic power, empirical testability, ability to solve central philosophical problems (including the 'hard problem'), and philosophical coherence without problematic metaphysical assumptions.

Compared to **pure Predictive Processing theories**, EPET fully addresses conscious accessibility and unity via explicit integration with Global Workspace Theory and embodiment. In contrast to **standard Global Workspace Theory alone**, EPET’s integration of Predictive Processing provides a mechanistic and embodied explanation of qualia and subjective content generation.

Unlike **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**, EPET avoids computational intractability and panpsychist implications, providing a clear emergentist physicalist framework that explains consciousness dynamically and empirically testably. EPET rejects **illusionism’s** counterintuitive denial of phenomenality, instead providing a naturalistic and constitutive account of qualia consistent with empirical data and phenomenological intuitions.

EPET also surpasses **panpsychism** by resolving the combination problem and avoiding its empirical untestability. Compared to **Higher-Order theories**, EPET explains phenomenal consciousness at a primary process level, thus sidestepping difficulties associated with infinite regress and meta-representation. Finally, relative to **other integrative approaches (IWMT, MUM)**, EPET is distinguished by its explicit philosophical rigor, precise predictions, clear conceptual constraints, and empirically grounded hypotheses.

EPET thus offers a philosophically preferable alternative to competing approaches, avoiding extremes such as dualism, panpsychism, or illusionism, and stating empirical conditions under which its core predictions can be falsified or supported, thus aligning itself clearly with scientific rigor and explanatory adequacy within the complex landscape of current consciousness theories [@sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025].
