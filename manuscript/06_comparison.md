# 6. Comparison of EPET with Other Theories of Consciousness

Comparing EPET with other theories highlights its strengths and positioning. EPET is an integrative, emergentist, first-order theory using PP and GWT within non-reductive physicalism, conceptually enriched by Buddhism.

## 6.1. EPET vs. Global Workspace Theory (GWT/GNWT)

-   **Similarities:** EPET integrates GWT's [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] global availability mechanism [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014] for **conscious access**, integration, and unity.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** GWT focuses on access mechanisms, less on content generation/quality. EPET **supplements GWT** with **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013] as the mechanism generating content and qualia**. While integrating GWT/PP is explored elsewhere [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @whyteIntegratingGlobalNeuronal2019; @whytePredictiveGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET uses this integration for a philosophical theory explaining qualia as properties of the predictive process (Section 4), not just global availability. EPET also explicitly includes **embodiment/interoception** [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @damasioDescartesError2006] (via PP) and emphasizes the **active, predictive** nature of consciousness. EPET uses this integration primarily to build a philosophical theory explaining qualia as intrinsic process properties, explicitly incorporating embodiment and Buddhist constraints.
    

## 6.2. EPET vs. Predictive Processing Theories (PP/PC/FEP)

-   **Similarities:** EPET uses **PP [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013] as the primary mechanism** for perception, action, attention, interoception, and generating conscious content/quality. Many EPET explanations (qualia, self-model) build on PP.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** PP-only theories can be criticized for lacking rigor in explaining consciousness [@litwinUnificationFiatArrested2020] or struggle with the conscious/unconscious boundary and global integration. EPET **supplements PP with GWT** [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], proposing **global availability** as necessary for conscious access/integration of PP-generated content. While PP/GWT integration is explored [@auroraalegianiCombiningGlobalNeuronal2021], EPET offers a **unique philosophical interpretation**: qualia as emergent process properties, PP/GWT within an **emergentist framework** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999], and active use of **Buddhist concepts** (Anattā, Paṭiccasamuppāda) as constraints/guides. EPET offers a unique philosophical interpretation of this synthesis within an emergentist framework explicitly guided by Buddhist principles like Anattā.
    

## 6.3. EPET vs. Other Integrative Approaches (IWMT, MUM)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Other FEP-based integrations like IWMT [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] or MUM [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023] aim for broader scope (incl. IIT, Attention Schema) using complex constructs. EPET chooses a **more focused set of core components** (PP, GWT, Embodiment, Buddhism) to build a **specific philosophical theory** explaining qualia and self. EPET's metaphysics (emergentism + Buddhism) also differ. EPET aims for conceptual clarity and direct connection to philosophical problems, not maximal abstract coverage.
    

## 6.4. EPET vs. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

-   **Similarities:** Both recognize **information integration** as key.
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** IIT [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016] uses a static measure (Φ), leading to computational issues and **panpsychist implications**. EPET sees integration as a **dynamic process** via specific mechanisms (PP, GWT), connecting better with cognition/brain dynamics. EPET avoids panpsychism and the combination problem, staying within emergentist physicalism, aligning better with **Paṭiccasamuppāda** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

## 6.5. EPET vs. Higher-Order Theories (HOR: HOT/HOP)

-   **Differences/Advantages:** HOR [@carruthersHigherOrderTheoriesConsciousness2023] require meta-representation for consciousness. EPET is **first-order**: phenomenal quality (qualia) is a property of the **primary process** (integrated predictive modeling). This avoids HOR problems (regress, quality generation by meta-representation). EPET links **meta-representational abilities** to **self-awareness/introspection/self-sense** (via self-modeling in PP [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @metzingerBeingNoOne2004]), not basic phenomenality.
    

## 6.6. EPET vs. Functionalism

-   **Similarities:** Shares emphasis on **processual nature** and **functional role** (integration, control) [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013].
    
-   **Differences/Advantages:** Pure functionalism struggles with qualia [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. EPET argues that **specifics of physical realization** matter – the **intrinsic properties of the emergent, embodied process** (integrated predictive modeling). EPET addresses qualia by linking them to these process properties (Section 4).
    

## 6.7. EPET vs. Illusionism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness (qualia). EPET **rejects eliminativism**, recognizing subjective experience as the explanandum. EPET aims to **explain experience** as a real property of an emergent process. It agrees that beliefs about qualia/self might be mistaken [@dennettQuiningQualia1988], but not the underlying experience.
    

## 6.8. EPET vs. Panpsychism

-   **Differences/Advantages:** Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017] posits consciousness as fundamental. EPET is **emergentist**: consciousness arises only in complex, specifically organized systems. EPET avoids the **combination problem** and aligns better with lack of evidence for simple system consciousness and **Paṭiccasamuppāda**.
    

## 6.9. Conclusion: Positioning EPET

EPET occupies a unique niche as an **integrative, emergentist, first-order theory**. While PP/GWT synthesis is explored elsewhere, EPET is distinguished by its **philosophical focus**, **specific component set**, and **integration with Buddhist concepts**. It offers a naturalistic, non-eliminative, non-reductive explanation of **qualia** and **self**, compatible with science and Buddhism, aiming for a coherent response amidst theoretical disagreements [@sethUnpackingComplexitiesConsciousness2025]. Avoiding extremes, EPET provides a framework for understanding consciousness.
