# 2. The Metaphysical Foundation of EPET: Emergentist Physicalism and Dependent Origination

Any consciousness theory relies on metaphysical assumptions. EPET articulates its position for scientific plausibility, conceptual coherence, and compatibility with the Buddhist principle of dependent origination.

## 2.1. Adopting Physicalism

EPET adopts **physicalism**: everything existing is physical or constituted/realized by physical entities/processes [@stoljarPhysicalism2024]. This rejects **substance dualism** (a separate mental substance) and ensures compatibility with science, which finds no evidence for non-material substance and shows consciousness depends on physical brain/body processes.

## 2.2. Choosing Non-Reductive Emergentism

Within physicalism, EPET rejects strong reductionism and eliminative materialism, adopting instead **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004]. This stance affirms that consciousness and qualia are **real processes** requiring explanation, not elimination. Consciousness is viewed as an **emergent process/property**, arising from the complex organization and dynamics of the brain-body-environment system, rather than being inherent in its fundamental components.

EPET specifically adheres to **weak (or epistemic) emergence** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997; @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006]. This entails:
(1) **Ontological Dependence:** Conscious processes are fully determined by and supervene on underlying physical processes, with no violation of physical laws. However, this dependence allows for **genuinely novel system-level properties** that are not merely aggregative [@feinberg2020phenomenal; @oconnorEmergentProperties2021].
(2) **Epistemic Irreducibility:** The properties and dynamics of consciousness cannot be fully explained or predicted solely in low-level physics terms; higher-level concepts are indispensable.
(3) **Rejection of Strong Emergence:** EPET does not posit consciousness as having fundamental causal powers that alter or supplement fundamental physical laws, maintaining consistency with the causal closure of the physical at that level [@oconnorEmergentProperties2021].
(4) **Causal Efficacy:** As a high-level emergent process, consciousness is considered **causally efficacious** [@kimMindPhysicalWorld2000]. It participates in causal chains as an organizational pattern guiding lower-level dynamics, its relevance understandable via frameworks like interventionism or as the causal power of high-level realizers [@woodwardMakingThingsHappen2005; @Negro2022; @Cea2021].
Thus, EPET’s metaphysics acknowledges consciousness's reality and causal role within a physicalist worldview.


## 2.3. Emergentism and the Buddhist Principle of Conditionality

EPET's emergentist physicalism conceptually resonates with the Buddhist principle of **conditionality (dependent origination)**, which posits that phenomena, including consciousness, lack inherent, independent existence and arise interdependently based on a web of conditions [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012].

This resonance is evident in several parallels:
1.  **Conditionality of Consciousness:** EPET views consciousness as arising only under complex specific conditions (a functioning brain-body system, environmental interaction, specific neural patterns), aligning with the Buddhist emphasis on conditionality.
2.  **Absence of a Substantial Basis:** Just as Buddhist thought (particularly *Anattā*) denies a permanent, independent self (Ātman), EPET’s emergentism rejects any separate mental substance or fundamental, universally distributed consciousness. Consciousness is a pattern of organization, not an independent "thing."
3.  **Interdependence:** The Buddhist emphasis on the interdependence of phenomena mirrors the scientific view of emergent systems. EPET’s emergentism implies complex, bidirectional interactions across levels of organization and between the system and its environment, where consciousness is a novel, system-level phenomenon arising from these intricate interdependencies.

This metaphysical grounding, emphasizing conditionality and non-substantiality, supports EPET's specific theses on the nature of conscious experience as an emergent process with intrinsic phenomenal characteristics.
