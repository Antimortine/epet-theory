# 2. The Metaphysical Foundation of EPET: Emergentist Physicalism and Dependent Origination

Any consciousness theory relies on metaphysical assumptions. EPET articulates its position for scientific plausibility, conceptual coherence, and compatibility with the Buddhist principle of dependent origination.

## 2.1. Adopting Physicalism

EPET adopts **physicalism**: everything existing is physical or constituted/realized by physical entities/processes [@stoljarPhysicalism2024]. This rejects **substance dualism** (a separate mental substance) and ensures compatibility with science, which finds no evidence for non-material substance and shows consciousness depends on physical brain/body processes.

## 2.2. Choosing Non-Reductive Emergentism

Within physicalism, EPET rejects **strong reductionism** [@brigandtReductionismBiology2008] and **eliminative materialism** [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981]. It adopts **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004]. Key tenets:

1.  **Reality of Consciousness:** Consciousness and qualia are **real processes** requiring explanation, not elimination.
    
2.  **Emergence:** Consciousness is an **emergent process/property**, arising from the **complex organization and dynamics** of a physical system (brain-body-environment), not inherent in its components.
    
3.  **Type of Emergence: Weak/Epistemic:** EPET adheres to **weak** or **epistemic emergence** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997; @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006]:
    
    -   Ontological Dependence: Conscious processes are fully **determined** by and **supervene** on underlying physical processes [@davidson5MentalEvents1980; @kimSupervenienceMindSelected1993]. No violation of physics laws occurs. Nevertheless, this dependence does not preclude the manifestation of **genuinely novel properties** at the system level. As argued by proponents of weak emergence, such properties, while entirely grounded in the organization and dynamics of their physical constituents, are not merely aggregative and possess characteristics distinct from those of their components [@Feinberg2020; @OConnor2021].
        
    -   Epistemic Irreducibility: Consciousness properties/dynamics **cannot be fully explained or predicted** solely in low-level physics terms. Higher-level concepts (cognitive science, EPET) are **indispensable**.
        
    -   Rejection of Strong Emergence: EPET does not posit consciousness having fundamental causal powers altering physics laws [@OConnor2021]. This rejection stems from the commitment to the ontological dependence of consciousness on underlying physical processes and the principle of the causal closure of the physical domain at the fundamental level, thus avoiding the postulation of novel 'downward causation' in the sense of forces that would violate or supplement fundamental physics. While high-level emergent states can provide 'downward explanation' or act as organizational constraints, they do so by orchestrating existing physical laws, not by introducing new fundamental interactions.
        
4.  **Causal Efficacy:** Consciousness as a high-level process is **causally efficacious** [@kimMindPhysicalWorld2000]. High-level causal descriptions (e.g., "awareness of danger caused fear") are valid explanations, realized via physical processes. The conscious process participates in causal chains not by altering fundamental physical laws, but by acting as a higher-level organizational pattern that constrains and guides lower-level neural dynamics towards adaptive behavioral outcomes. Its causal relevance can be understood through frameworks like interventionism, where changes in the conscious state reliably lead to changes in behavior. Furthermore, this efficacy can be conceptualized through ideas such as 'global-to-local determination' where the emergent whole constrains its parts [@Negro2022], or by viewing conscious states as high-level realizers that inherit causal powers from their micro-configurations, thus avoiding causal exclusion arguments [@Cea2021].
    

EPET's metaphysics acknowledges consciousness's reality and causal role without dualism, maintaining compatibility with the physical worldview.


## 2.3. Emergentism and the Buddhist Principle of Conditionality

EPET's emergentist physicalism resonates conceptually with core aspects of **the Buddhist principle of conditionality, often referred to as dependent origination** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012]. This fundamental Buddhist principle posits that phenomena lack inherent, independent existence and arise interdependently based on a web of conditions. When applied to consciousness, this means it is understood as arising conditionally, not as a static or primary, uncaused reality.

EPET's emergentist framework offers conceptual parallels to this perspective:

1.  **Conditionality of Consciousness:** In EPET, consciousness is understood to arise only under **complex specific conditions** (a functioning brain and body, active interaction with an environment, and specific neural and information-processing patterns). Without these requisite conditions, consciousness, as an emergent process, would not manifest. This aligns with the emphasis on conditionality found in the Buddhist principle.
    
2.  **Absence of a Substantial Basis:** The Buddhist principle of dependent origination, particularly in its denial of a permanent, independent self (traditionally termed Ātman in related Indian philosophies, a notion critiqued by the Buddhist concept of Anattā), finds a parallel in EPET's emergentism. EPET, by its physicalist and emergentist nature, denies any separate mental substance or the panpsychist notion of universally distributed fundamental consciousness. Instead, consciousness is viewed as a **pattern of organization and activity** within a physical system, not an independent "thing" or essence.
    
3.  **Interdependence:** The Buddhist emphasis on the **interdependence** of all phenomena, including consciousness and its mental and physical components, resonates with the scientific view of emergent systems. Emergentism, as adopted by EPET, implies complex, **bidirectional interactions** between different levels of organization—from neuronal activity to network dynamics, to cognitive processes, and ultimately to behavior—as well as continuous interaction between the system and its environment. This view of consciousness as a **novel, system-level phenomenon arising from, yet wholly dependent on, such intricate interdependencies** finds a conceptual echo in the Buddhist understanding of all phenomena as dependently arisen.
    

Thus, EPET's non-reductive emergentist physicalism not only ensures its scientific plausibility but also integrates a conceptual structure that is strikingly harmonious with the philosophical implications of the Buddhist principle of dependent origination. This metaphysical grounding further supports EPET's specific theses on the nature of conscious experience **as an emergent process with intrinsic phenomenal characteristics.**
