# 2. The Metaphysical Foundation of EPET: Emergentist Physicalism and Dependent Origination

  

Any theory of consciousness, implicitly or explicitly, relies on certain metaphysical assumptions about the nature of reality and the place of consciousness within it. The Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) consciously chooses and articulates its metaphysical position, aiming to ensure both scientific plausibility and conceptual coherence, as well as compatibility with the principle of dependent origination borrowed from Buddhist philosophy.

  

## 2.1. Adopting Physicalism

  

As a starting point, EPET adopts **physicalism** – a widely held ontological position in contemporary science and philosophy, according to which everything that exists is physical or is constituted/realized by physical entities, properties, and processes [see review in @stoljarPhysicalism2024]. This implies a rejection of **substance dualism**, i.e., the idea of a separate, non-material mental substance (soul) fundamentally distinct from the physical world. Adopting physicalism ensures maximum compatibility of the theory with the data from natural sciences, which find no evidence for such a non-material substance and convincingly demonstrate the dependence of consciousness on physical processes in the brain and body.

  

## 2.2. Choosing Non-Reductive Emergentism

  

However, different positions exist within physicalism. EPET rejects **strong reductionism** (identifying mental states with neural states without remainder) [see discussion in @brigandtReductionismBiology2008] and **eliminative materialism** [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981]. Instead, EPET adopts **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004]. The key tenets of this position are:

  

1.  **Reality of Consciousness:** Consciousness and its qualitative properties (qualia) are treated as **real phenomena (processes)** that require explanation, not elimination or reduction to something else.

2.  **Emergence:** Consciousness is an **emergent process/property**. It arises ("emerges") from the **complex organization and specific dynamics** of a physical system (the brain-body interacting with the environment) but is not inherent in its individual components (neurons) or simple systems.

3.  **Type of Emergence: Weak/Epistemic:** EPET adheres to the concept of **weak** or **epistemic emergence** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997; see also @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006]. This means that:

*  *Ontological Dependence:* The conscious process is fully **determined** by the underlying physical processes and **supervenes** on them [@davidson5MentalEvents1980; @kimSupervenienceMindSelected1993] (there can be no change in consciousness without a change in the physical base). There is no violation of the laws of physics.

*  *Epistemic Irreducibility:* The properties and dynamics of consciousness **cannot be fully explained or predicted** solely in the language of low-level physics. Understanding them requires higher-level concepts and laws (from cognitive science, psychology, EPET). Describing consciousness at its own phenomenal and functional level is **indispensable** for a complete understanding of the system.

*  *Rejection of Strong Emergence:* EPET does not posit that consciousness has its own fundamental causal powers capable of "downwardly" altering the laws of physics [see discussion of strong emergence in @oconnorEmergentProperties2021].

4.  **Causal Efficacy:** Within this understanding of emergence, consciousness as a high-level process is **causally efficacious** [see discussion in @kimMindPhysicalWorld2000]. Describing causal links at the level of conscious states (e.g., "the awareness of danger caused fear and flight") is a valid and informative explanation of behavior, even if it is fully realized through underlying physical processes. The conscious process as a whole participates in the causal chains of the world.

  

Thus, the metaphysical foundation of EPET allows for acknowledging the reality and causal significance of consciousness without falling into dualism and while maintaining compatibility with the physical worldview.

  

## 2.3. Compatibility with *Paṭiccasamuppāda* (Dependent Origination)

  

The chosen position of emergentist physicalism reveals a deep structural correspondence with the fundamental Buddhist principle of **Paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012]. This principle asserts that all phenomena lack independent, self-existent being and arise interdependently, due to the presence of specific conditions. Applied to consciousness (*Viññāṇa*), this means it is neither a primary reality nor an unchanging essence, but arises conditionally.

  

EPET's emergentist physicalism harmonizes completely with this view:

  

1.  **Conditionality of Consciousness:** EPET asserts that consciousness arises only under **complex specific conditions**: a functioning brain of a certain architecture, a living body, interaction with the environment, and specific patterns of neural activity and information processing (as will be shown later, related to integrated predictive modeling). When these conditions are removed (e.g., in death, anesthesia, severe brain damage), consciousness disappears.

2.  **Absence of a Substantial Basis:** Just as *Paṭiccasamuppāda* denies *Ātman* (an unchanging soul), EPET's emergentism denies both a non-material mental substance and the idea of consciousness as a fundamental property of matter (panpsychism). Consciousness is a **pattern of organization and activity**, not a thing.

3.  **Interdependence:**  *Paṭiccasamuppāda* emphasizes the interdependence of factors (e.g., consciousness and the mental-physical components of experience). Emergentism also implies complex, **bidirectional interactions** between levels of organization (neurons <-> networks <-> cognitive processes <-> behavior) and between the system and the environment.

  

Therefore, adopting non-reductive emergentist physicalism not only ensures the scientific plausibility of EPET but also allows integrating into its foundation a conceptual structure that resonates with the principle of dependent origination – one of the key insights of Buddhist philosophy regarding the nature of reality and mind. This metaphysical position forms the foundation for the subsequent exposition of EPET's specific theses about the nature of consciousness.
