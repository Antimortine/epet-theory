# 2. The Metaphysical Foundation of EPET: Emergentist Physicalism and Dependent Origination

Any consciousness theory relies on metaphysical assumptions. EPET articulates its position for scientific plausibility, conceptual coherence, and compatibility with Buddhist dependent origination.

## 2.1. Adopting Physicalism

EPET adopts **physicalism**: everything existing is physical or constituted/realized by physical entities/processes [@stoljarPhysicalism2024]. This rejects **substance dualism** (a separate mental substance) and ensures compatibility with science, which finds no evidence for non-material substance and shows consciousness depends on physical brain/body processes.

## 2.2. Choosing Non-Reductive Emergentism

Within physicalism, EPET rejects **strong reductionism** [@brigandtReductionismBiology2008] and **eliminative materialism** [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981]. It adopts **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997; @claytonMindEmergenceQuantum2004]. Key tenets:

1.  **Reality of Consciousness:** Consciousness and qualia are **real processes** requiring explanation, not elimination.
    
2.  **Emergence:** Consciousness is an **emergent process/property**, arising from the **complex organization and dynamics** of a physical system (brain-body-environment), not inherent in its components.
    
3.  **Type of Emergence: Weak/Epistemic:** EPET adheres to **weak** or **epistemic emergence** [@bedauWeakEmergence1997; @chalmersStrongWeakEmergence2006]:
    
    -   Ontological Dependence: Conscious processes are fully **determined** by and **supervene** on underlying physical processes [@davidson5MentalEvents1980; @kimSupervenienceMindSelected1993]. No violation of physics laws.
        
    -   Epistemic Irreducibility: Consciousness properties/dynamics **cannot be fully explained or predicted** solely in low-level physics terms. Higher-level concepts (cognitive science, EPET) are **indispensable**.
        
    -   Rejection of Strong Emergence: EPET does not posit consciousness having fundamental causal powers altering physics laws [@oconnorEmergentProperties2021].
        
4.  **Causal Efficacy:** Consciousness as a high-level process is **causally efficacious** [@kimMindPhysicalWorld2000]. High-level causal descriptions (e.g., "awareness of danger caused fear") are valid explanations, realized via physical processes. The conscious process participates in causal chains.
    

EPET's metaphysics acknowledges consciousness's reality and causal role without dualism, maintaining compatibility with the physical worldview.

## 2.3. Compatibility with Paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination)

Emergentist physicalism corresponds structurally with the Buddhist principle of **Paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination)** [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012]. This principle states phenomena lack independent existence, arising interdependently based on conditions. Applied to consciousness (Viññāṇa), it means it arises conditionally, not as a primary reality.

EPET's emergentism harmonizes with this:

1.  **Conditionality of Consciousness:** Consciousness arises only under **complex specific conditions** (functioning brain/body, interaction, specific neural/information processing patterns). Without these conditions, consciousness disappears.
    
2.  **Absence of a Substantial Basis:** Like Paṭiccasamuppāda denies Ātman, EPET's emergentism denies mental substance and panpsychism. Consciousness is a **pattern of organization/activity**, not a thing.
    
3.  **Interdependence:**  Paṭiccasamuppāda emphasizes interdependence (consciousness & mental-physical components). Emergentism implies complex, **bidirectional interactions** between levels (neurons <-> networks <-> cognition <-> behavior) and system-environment.
    

Thus, non-reductive emergentist physicalism ensures EPET's scientific plausibility and integrates a conceptual structure resonant with dependent origination. This forms the foundation for EPET's specific theses.
