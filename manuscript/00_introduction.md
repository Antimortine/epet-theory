# Introduction: Towards an Integrative Theory of Consciousness

## The Enigma of Consciousness

Consciousness is a profound phenomenon. Each of us has direct access to our subjective experience: seeing colors, hearing sounds, feeling emotions, and being aware of ourselves. This inner qualitative aspect—the "what is it like?" [@nagelWhatItLikeBat1980, pp. 159–160]—constitutes consciousness. This subjectivity poses a fundamental problem: How to reconcile this private world with the objective picture from science? How does the brain generate the seemingly immaterial quality of experience?

This "hard problem of consciousness" [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995, p. 201] remains a major intellectual challenge. Despite progress in mapping neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) [@kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017, Ch. 8; @tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], the gap between brain processes and subjective quality persists. Solving this enigma requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating data from neurobiology, cognitive psychology, physics, philosophy, and potentially other traditions.

## Existing Approaches and Their Limitations

Numerous theories attempt to resolve the consciousness problem. Substance dualism [@swinburneEvolutionSoul1997, xi–xii, 10, 145–60, 322–31] faces the interaction problem and aligns poorly with science. Radical reductive physicalism (identity theories [@placeConsciousnessBrainProcess1956, 45; @smartSensationsBrainProcesses1959, pp. 154–156] or eliminativism [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981, p. 67]) is often accused of ignoring subjective quality (qualia). Functionalism [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013] struggles to explain why function entails experience [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993, pp. 354–358; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness, appearing counterintuitive. Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017, chap. 7–9; @chalmersPanpsychismPanprotopsychism2013] faces the combination problem and lacks empirical confirmation.

Each approach has strengths, but none offers a comprehensive solution. A fruitful path forward lies in an **integrative theory** synthesizing valuable ideas and data while avoiding extremes.

## Introducing the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)

This work formulates such an integrative theory—the **Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)**. It is a philosophical theory grounded in **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999, 12; @bedauWeakEmergence1997, p. 377–379], viewing consciousness not as a fundamental property or a separate substance, but as a **real, emergent, and dynamic process** that arises from the specific organization and activity of a complex physical system (the brain-body) interacting with its environment.

EPET builds upon and integrates several key developments in cognitive science and philosophy:

1.  **Predictive Processing Theories (PP / Predictive Coding, PC / Free-Energy Principle, FEP):** These frameworks view the brain as a prediction machine constantly generating and updating models of the world and the self [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010, 127; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013, pp. 1—3; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013, Ch. 1].
    
2.  **Global Workspace Theory (GWT / Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, GNWT):** This theory explains how information becomes consciously accessed, integrated, and globally broadcast to various cognitive systems [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014].
    
3.  **Embodied and Enactive Cognition Concepts:** These approaches emphasize the inextricable link between consciousness, the living body, action, and the environment, with a particular focus on interoception and its role in affect and self-awareness [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @clarkBeingTherePutting1998; @damasioDescartesError2006, Ch. 10; @sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013, pp. 565–567].
    
The novelty of EPET lies not merely in selecting and combining these established components. Crucially, it synthesizes and interprets them philosophically to form an integrative framework that addresses core problems of consciousness. EPET distinctively articulates a philosophically rigorous position of **emergentist physicalism**, proposing (1) a **constitutive explanation of qualia** as intrinsic properties of the integrated, embodied predictive modeling process; (2) a **naturalistic account of the self** as a dynamically maintained self-model, a view that is conceptually constrained by and compatible with the Buddhist principle of *Anattā* (no-self); and (3) a coherent approach to the **unity of consciousness**, achieved through the integrative function of the global workspace operating on hierarchically structured predictive models. By focusing on these specific philosophical challenges, EPET aims to provide a framework that avoids the pitfalls of substance dualism, panpsychism, and strong reductionism/illusionism. Thus, EPET's primary contribution lies not in inventing new mechanisms *de novo*, but in providing a novel, coherent, and philosophically grounded *interpretation* of how established and plausible mechanisms (PP, GWT, Embodiment) collectively realize consciousness and selfhood under specific emergentist and conceptual (Buddhist-informed) constraints.

This unique synthesis provides novel heuristic and explanatory power. EPET generates specific, empirically testable hypotheses (e.g., dissociating qualia intensity from access via precision weighting—or explaining affective valence through interoceptive prediction-error dynamics) that are not straightforwardly offered by any single constituent theory alone.

In contrast to some other integrative approaches, such as Safron's Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] which incorporates Integrated Information Theory, or the potentially more formal and broader scope of Ramstead et al.'s Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023], EPET deliberately employs a focused conceptual framework. This framework is characterized by its explicit commitment to weak emergentism and the use of select Buddhist philosophical insights (particularly *Anattā* and process ontology derived from principles like impermanence and dependent origination, as discussed in Section 1.3) as conceptual constraints. This specific focus allows EPET to offer greater clarity and specificity in its explanations of phenomenal experience and selfhood, and in its generation of testable predictions concerning these aspects of consciousness.

## Three Guiding Principles of EPET

EPET development followed three criteria:

1.  **Scientific Plausibility:** Compatibility with established scientific data and plausible models.
    
2.  **Consistency with Buddhist Core:** Compatibility with key Buddhist insights, such as the principle of **no-self (Anattā)**, the understanding of reality as a dynamic **process (encompassing impermanence and dependent origination)**, and the tradition's rich **phenomenological analysis of experience** (e.g., its deconstruction into constituent aggregates) [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007, pp. 36–40, 74–89; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012, pp. 57–62, 65–73, 82; @gethinFoundationsBuddhism1998, pp. 133–162]. It was chosen not for religious reasons but for the value of this tradition's investigation of the mind, offering heuristic tools and insights compatible with science.
    
3.  **Form and Style:** Using contemporary philosophy of mind terminology and argumentation for dialogue.
    
Adherence to these principles aims for a theory that is empirically grounded, conceptually rich, and accessible for interdisciplinary discussion.


EPET's central ideas include consciousness as an **emergent, embodied, dynamic process**, realized through **integrated predictive modeling**; **qualia** as **intrinsic properties of this process**, reflecting modeled interactions and their relevance; and the phenomenal **"self"** as an **emergent construct** from **recursive self-modeling**, aligning with **Anattā (no-self)**.

The manuscript is structured as follows: **Section 1** summarizes the scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations. **Section 2** outlines the emergentist physicalism basis and its compatibility with dependent origination. **Section 3** formulates EPET's central theses on consciousness, mechanisms, and the self. **Section 4** explains subjectivity and qualia within EPET, addressing the 'hard problem'. **Section 5** presents arguments and empirical/conceptual support. **Section 6** compares EPET with other major theories. **Section 7** discusses potential objections and responses. Finally, **Section 8** concludes with strengths, limitations, and future research directions.

This manuscript aims not for a final solution, but to formulate a **coherent, plausible, and heuristically valuable framework** for understanding consciousness. EPET seeks to show that integrating scientific models, emergentist philosophy, and Buddhist concepts can open new perspectives. We hope the theory stimulates discussion, critique, and new research towards understanding consciousness.
