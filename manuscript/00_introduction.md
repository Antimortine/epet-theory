# Introduction: Towards an Integrative Theory of Consciousness

## 1. The Enigma of Consciousness

Consciousness is a profound phenomenon. Each of us has direct access to our subjective experience: seeing colors, hearing sounds, feeling emotions, being aware of ourselves. This inner, qualitative aspect, the "what is it like?" [@nagelWhatItLikeBat1980], constitutes consciousness. This subjectivity poses a fundamental problem: How to reconcile this private world with the objective picture from science? How does the brain generate the seemingly immaterial quality of experience?

This "hard problem of consciousness" [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995] remains a major intellectual challenge. Despite progress in mapping neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) [@kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017; @tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], the gap between brain processes and subjective quality persists. Solving this enigma requires an interdisciplinary approach integrating data from neurobiology, cognitive psychology, physics, philosophy, and potentially other traditions.

## 2. Existing Approaches and Their Limitations

Numerous theories attempt to resolve the consciousness problem. Substance dualism [@swinburneEvolutionSoul1997] faces the interaction problem and aligns poorly with science. Radical reductive physicalism (identity theories [@placeConsciousnessBrainProcess1956; @smartSensationsBrainProcesses1959] or eliminativism [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981]) is often accused of ignoring subjective quality (qualia). Functionalism [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013] struggles to explain why function entails experience [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]. Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016] denies phenomenal consciousness, appearing counterintuitive. Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017; @chalmersPanpsychismPanprotopsychism2013] faces the combination problem and lacks empirical confirmation.

Each approach has strengths, but none offers a comprehensive solution. A fruitful path forward lies in an **integrative theory** synthesizing valuable ideas and data while avoiding extremes.

## 3. Introducing the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)

This work formulates such an integrative theory – the **Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)**. It is a philosophical theory based on **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997]. It views consciousness not as fundamental or a separate substance, but as a **real, emergent, dynamic process** arising from the organization and activity of a complex physical system (brain-body) interacting with its environment.

EPET builds upon key developments in cognitive science:

-   **Predictive Processing Theories (PP / Predictive Coding, PC / Free-Energy Principle, FEP):** Viewing the brain as a prediction machine modeling the world and self [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].
    
-   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT / Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, GNWT):** Explaining information integration and conscious access via broadcasting [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014].
    
-   **Embodied Cognition Concepts:** Emphasizing the link between consciousness, body, action, and environment, including interoception [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @clarkBeingTherePutting1998; @damasioDescartesError2006; @sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013].
    

EPET integrates these components into a coherent structure to explain key aspects of consciousness, including subjectivity. The novelty of EPET lies not merely in combining existing components (Predictive Processing, Global Workspace Theory, embodiment, and Buddhist concepts), but specifically in their deep and systematic **philosophical synthesis**, which forms a fundamentally new integrative model of consciousness. EPET distinctively articulates a philosophically rigorous position that aims to successfully address central problems in consciousness studies, such as the 'hard problem' of qualia and the unity of consciousness without a substantial subject. Furthermore, it offers a specific account of the role of embodiment and interoception in phenomenal experience, while avoiding both dualism and panpsychism.

This unique synthesis provides novel heuristic and explanatory power: EPET generates specific, empirically testable hypotheses (e.g., dissociating qualia intensity from access via precision weighting, explaining affective valence via interoceptive prediction error) not offered by any single constituent theory alone.

In contrast to some other integrative approaches (e.g., Safron's Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) [@safronIntegratedWorldModeling2020] or Ramstead et al.'s Minimal Unifying Model (MUM) [@ramsteadStepsMinimalUnifying2023]), EPET deliberately employs a clear conceptual framework of weak emergentism combined with explicit Buddhist conceptual constraints. This focus allows for greater clarity and specificity in its predictions and explanations compared to potentially more abstract or broader integrative models.

## 4. Three Guiding Principles of EPET

EPET development followed three criteria:

1.  **Scientific Plausibility:** Compatibility with established scientific data and plausible models.
    
2.  **Consistency with Buddhist Core:** Compatibility with key Buddhist insights like Anattā (no-self), Anicca (impermanence), Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent origination), and experience analysis (Pañca Khandhā) [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @gethinFoundationsBuddhism1998]. Chosen not for religious reasons, but for the value of this tradition's investigation of mind, offering heuristic tools and insights compatible with science.
    
3.  **Form and Style:** Using contemporary philosophy of mind terminology and argumentation for dialogue.
    

Adherence to these principles aims for a theory that is empirically grounded, conceptually rich, and accessible for interdisciplinary discussion.

## 5. Brief Preview of EPET's Key Ideas

EPET's central ideas include:

-   Consciousness as an **emergent, embodied, dynamic process**, realized through **integrated predictive modeling**.
    
-   **Qualia** as **intrinsic properties of the predictive modeling process**, reflecting how the system models interactions and their relevance.
    
-   The phenomenal **"self"** as an **emergent construct** from **recursive self-modeling**, aligning with **Anattā (no-self)**.
    

## 6. Structure of the Manuscript

-   **Section 1:** Summarizes scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations.
    
-   **Section 2:** Outlines the emergentist physicalism basis and its compatibility with dependent origination.
    
-   **Section 3:** Formulates EPET's central theses on consciousness, mechanisms, and self.
    
-   **Section 4:** Explains subjectivity and qualia within EPET, addressing the 'hard problem'.
    
-   **Section 5:** Presents arguments and empirical/conceptual support for EPET.
    
-   **Section 6:** Compares EPET with other major theories.
    
-   **Section 7:** Discusses potential objections and responses.
    
-   **Section 8:** Concludes with strengths, limitations, and future research directions.
    

## 7. Overall Aim and Scope

This manuscript aims not for a final solution, but to formulate a **coherent, plausible, and heuristically valuable framework** for understanding consciousness. EPET seeks to show that integrating scientific models, emergentist philosophy, and Buddhist concepts can open new perspectives. We hope the theory stimulates discussion, critique, and new research towards understanding consciousness.
