# Introduction: Towards an Integrative Theory of Consciousness

## 1. The Enigma of Consciousness

Consciousness is one of the most profound and intriguing phenomena in the universe. Each of us has direct access to our own stream of subjective experience: we see colors, hear sounds, feel emotions, and are aware of ourselves as thinking and acting beings. This inner, qualitative aspect of reality, often described by the question "what is it like?" [@nagelPhilosophicalReview1974], constitutes the core of what we call consciousness. However, it is precisely this subjectivity that poses a fundamental problem for scientific and philosophical inquiry. How can we reconcile this private, first-person world with the objective picture of physical reality described by the natural sciences? How does the brain – a complex biological machine – give rise to the seemingly immaterial quality of experience?

This problem, known in contemporary philosophy as the "hard problem of consciousness" [@chalmersFacingProblemConsciousness1995], remains one of the major intellectual challenges of our time. Despite impressive progress in neuroscience in mapping the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) [@kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017; @tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], the gap between the objective description of brain processes and the subjective quality of experience persists. Solving this enigma clearly requires moving beyond narrow disciplinary boundaries and constructing an interdisciplinary approach capable of integrating data from neurobiology, cognitive psychology, physics, philosophy, and perhaps even insights from other traditions of mind research.

## 2. Existing Approaches and Their Limitations

Numerous theories have attempted to resolve the problem of consciousness. Substance dualism (classically formulated by Descartes, but also having contemporary proponents, e.g., [@swinburneEvolutionSoul1997]), which posits a separate mental substance, faces the interaction problem and aligns poorly with the scientific worldview. Radical reductive physicalism (e.g., identity theories [@placeConsciousnessBrainProcess1956; @smartSensationsBrainProcesses1959] or eliminativism [@churchlandEliminativeMaterialismPropositional1981]), which identifies consciousness with neural processes, is often accused of ignoring or eliminating the very essence of the phenomenon – its subjective quality (qualia). Functionalism [@putnamPsychologicalPredicates1967; @lewis15PsychophysicalTheoretical2013], defining consciousness through its causal role, struggles to explain why the performance of a specific function should be accompanied by any experience at all (see critique, e.g., in [@block22TroublesFunctionalism2013]). Illusionism [@dennettConsciousnessExplained1993; @frankishIllusionismTheoryConsciousness2016], which denies the reality of phenomenal consciousness in its intuitive sense, appears counterintuitive to many. Panpsychism [@strawsonRealisticMonismwhyPhysicalism2006; @goffConsciousnessFundamentalReality2017; see also discussion in @chalmersPanpsychismPanprotopsychism2013], attributing consciousness to the fundamental components of reality, faces the unresolved combination problem and lacks empirical confirmation.

Each of these approaches has its strengths, but none offers a universally accepted and comprehensive solution. It seems that a fruitful path forward lies in developing an **integrative theory** that can synthesize the most valuable ideas and empirical data while avoiding the extremes and dead ends of existing approaches.

## 3. Introducing the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)

The present work is an attempt to formulate such an integrative theory – the **Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET)**. It is a philosophical theory of consciousness based on the principles of **non-reductive (emergentist) physicalism** [@kimMakingSenseEmergence1999; @bedauWeakEmergence1997]. It views consciousness not as a fundamental property or a separate substance, but as a **real, emergent, dynamic process** arising from the specific organization and activity of a complex physical system (brain-body) interacting with its environment.

EPET does not aim to invent all components from scratch. Instead, it builds upon powerful theoretical and empirical developments in contemporary cognitive sciences, using them as "building blocks." Key among these are:

*   **Predictive Processing Theories (PP / Predictive Coding, PC / Free Energy Principle, FEP):** Viewing the brain as a prediction machine, constantly constructing and updating models of the world and itself [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].
*   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT / Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, GNWT):** Explaining the mechanisms of information integration and conscious access through broadcasting across the brain [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014].
*   **Embodied Cognition Concepts:** Emphasizing the inseparable link between consciousness, the body, action, and the environment, including the role of interoception [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @clarkBeingTherePutting1998; @damasioDescartesError2006; @sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013].

The task of EPET is to integrate these components into a single coherent structure capable of explaining the key aspects of consciousness, including its subjective quality.

## 4. Three Guiding Principles of EPET

The development of EPET was guided by three main criteria that the final theory should satisfy:

1.  **Scientific Plausibility:** The theory must be compatible with well-established data from modern sciences (neuroscience, cognitive science, physics) and rely on the most plausible scientific models.
2.  **Consistency with the Philosophical Core of Buddhism:** The theory should be compatible with key ontological and psychological insights of Buddhism, such as the doctrines of no-self (*Anattā*), impermanence (*Anicca*), dependent origination (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*), and the analysis of experience structure (e.g., through the Five Aggregates or *Pañca Khandhā*) [see, e.g., @rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @gethinFoundationsBuddhism1998]. This criterion was chosen not for religious reasons, but in recognition of the value of an alternative philosophical tradition that has deeply investigated the nature of mind and experience, offering potentially heuristic conceptual tools and phenomenological insights compatible with a scientific worldview.
3.  **Form and Style of Exposition:** The theory must be formulated using the terminology and argumentative strategies accepted in contemporary Western philosophy of mind to ensure the possibility of dialogue and critique within the mainstream academic discourse.

Adherence to these three principles allows, we hope, for the creation of a theory that is simultaneously empirically grounded, conceptually rich, and accessible for interdisciplinary discussion.

## 5. Brief Preview of EPET's Key Ideas

The central ideas of EPET, which will be detailed in subsequent sections, include:

*   Understanding consciousness as a specific type of **emergent, embodied, dynamic process**, realized through **integrated predictive modeling**.
*   Explaining **qualia** (subjective qualities of experience) not as separate entities, but as **intrinsic properties of the predictive modeling process itself**, reflecting the way the system models interactions and their relevance to itself.
*   Interpreting the phenomenal **sense of "self"** not as a reflection of a substantial soul, but as an **emergent construct**, the result of **recursive self-modeling** within the predictive system, which aligns fully with the Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā (no-self)**.

## 6. Structure of the Manuscript

This work is organized as follows:

*   **Section 1** briefly summarizes the scientific, philosophical, and Buddhist foundations upon which EPET is built.
*   **Section 2** outlines the adopted metaphysical basis – emergentist physicalism – and shows its compatibility with the principle of dependent origination.
*   **Section 3** formulates the central theses of EPET regarding the nature of consciousness, its mechanisms, and the sense of "self."
*   **Section 4** presents a detailed explanation of subjectivity and qualia within EPET, offering a response to the "hard problem."
*   **Section 5** supports the theory's theses with references to scientific data and demonstrates their compatibility with Buddhist concepts.
*   **Section 6** compares EPET with other influential theories of consciousness.
*   **Section 7** anticipates and responds to potential objections against the theory.
*   **Section 8** concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of EPET and outlining directions for future research.

## 7. Overall Aim and Scope

The aim of this manuscript is not to offer a final and irrefutable solution to the problem of consciousness, but to formulate a **coherent, plausible, and heuristically valuable theoretical framework** for understanding it. EPET seeks to show that integrating contemporary scientific models with emergentist philosophy and the conceptual tools of Buddhism can open new perspectives in the investigation of one of the most fundamental aspects of our existence. We hope that the proposed theory will serve as a stimulus for further discussions, critique, and, most importantly, for new research on the exciting path of understanding consciousness.
