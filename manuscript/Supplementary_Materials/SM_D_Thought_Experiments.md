# Supplementary Materials D: EPET and Classic Thought Experiments (Zombies, Mary's Room)

*(This section discusses EPET's stance on standard philosophical thought experiments often used to challenge physicalism.)*

Classic thought experiments like the Zombie Argument and the Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room) are often deployed to argue that physical facts do not exhaust all facts about consciousness, suggesting a non-physical aspect to experience. EPET, as a form of non-reductive physicalism, offers responses consistent with its core tenets.


**1. The Zombie Argument:**

*   **The Argument:** It claims we can conceive of (and therefore it is metaphysically possible to have) a "philosophical zombie" – a being physically and behaviorally identical to a conscious human but lacking any subjective experience (qualia). If zombies are possible, consciousness cannot be a purely physical property.
*   **EPET's Stance:** EPET denies the metaphysical possibility of philosophical zombies. Grounded in weak emergentism and a constitutive view of qualia (Section 4.4.2), EPET holds that phenomenal properties are high-level properties *realized by* specific complex physical organization and dynamics (the integrated, embodied predictive process). If a system is physically identical to a conscious human in all relevant organizational and dynamic aspects captured by EPET (hierarchical PP, GWT integration, embodied self-modeling, etc.), then it necessarily possesses the corresponding emergent phenomenal properties. To have the specific physical realization *is* to have the subjective experience.
*   **Explaining the Intuition:** The intuition that zombies are conceivable arises, according to EPET, from the **epistemic gap** between third-person descriptions of physical/functional states and first-person phenomenal experience, as explained by strategies like the Phenomenal Concept Strategy (PCS) (Section 4.4.4). We can conceptually separate the physical description from the phenomenal feel because our concepts for each are distinct, but this conceptual separability does not entail ontological separability. The conceivability argument relies on mistaking an epistemic gap for an ontological one.


**2. The Knowledge Argument (Mary's Room):**

*   **The Argument:** Mary knows all physical facts about color vision but has never seen color. When she sees red for the first time, does she learn something new? If yes, then physical facts are incomplete, as they didn't capture "what it's like" to see red.
*   **EPET's Stance:** Yes, Mary learns something new, but she does not learn a new *non-physical fact*. Instead, she acquires:

    *   **New Abilities/know-how:** The ability to recognize, imagine, and remember the experience of red from a first-person perspective.
    *   **Acquaintance Knowledge:** Direct acquaintance with the phenomenal quality itself, which was previously known only by description.
    *   **New Phenomenal Concepts:** She forms a new phenomenal concept of *this* specific qualitative experience [@balog2020disillusioned; @Diaz-Leon2020-DIATMO-2]. This concept is indexical or demonstrative and refers to the intrinsic quality of her brain state, but it contains information (the "what-it's-likeness") not captured by her previous third-person, theoretical concepts.
*   **Consistency with Physicalism:** This acquisition of new cognitive abilities and concepts is perfectly compatible with physicalism. The underlying reality Mary comes to know in a new way – the brain process constituting the experience of red – remains a physical process. EPET explains the "newness" by appealing to the difference between third-person theoretical knowledge and first-person acquaintance mediated by distinct epistemic perspectives and phenomenal concepts (Section 4.4.2, 4.4.4). Mary knew *about* the physical state realizing redness; now she *instantiates* that state and knows it directly, allowing her to form new concepts about it.


**3. The Inverted Spectrum Argument:**

*   **The Argument:** Can we conceive of someone whose color experiences are systematically inverted relative to ours (e.g., seeing green where we see red) but whose functional organization and behavior are identical? If so, functional states do not determine qualia.
*   **EPET's Stance:** EPET suggests that such inversion is unlikely if we consider *total physical and historical identity*. The specific neural patterns constituting "redness" vs. "greenness" are learned through interactions (Section 4.2) and depend on the specific physical realization of the predictive hierarchy. If two systems are physically identical *and* have identical learning histories, their predictive models for color should realize identical qualia. If the systems differ physically but are functionally isomorphic, EPET (not being a pure functionalism) allows for the possibility of different qualia, as the phenomenal character depends on the specifics of the physical realization (Section 6.6). Thus, the argument primarily challenges implementation-neutral functionalism, a position EPET rejects.


**4. Nagel's Bat Argument ("What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"):**

*   **The Argument:** Even with complete physical knowledge of a bat's brain and echolocation system, we cannot know *what it is like* to be a bat and experience the world that way. This highlights the irreducible subjectivity and first-person perspective of consciousness [@nagelWhatItLikeBat1980].
*   **EPET's Stance:** EPET agrees that we cannot experientially know what it's like to be a bat, but interprets this as an **epistemic limitation**, not an ontological one. Our human consciousness is realized by *our* specific integrated, embodied predictive system, with *our* sensory modalities and *our* type of self-model. We lack the requisite physical organization and conceptual framework (phenomenal concepts) to simulate or adopt the bat's first-person perspective. The bat's consciousness, however, is still viewed by EPET as a fully physical, emergent process realized by *its* specific brain and body. The argument highlights the inherent perspectival nature of consciousness (which EPET explains via embodied, egocentric modeling in Section 4.3) and the limits of inter-perspective understanding, but does not refute physicalism itself.


**5. Searle's Chinese Room Argument:**

*   **The Argument:** A person manipulating Chinese symbols according to rules can simulate understanding Chinese without actually understanding it. This challenges strong AI and functionalism by suggesting that syntax (rule-based manipulation) is insufficient for semantics (meaning) and, by implication, for consciousness [@searleIntentionalityEssayPhilosophy1983].
*   **EPET's Stance:** EPET aligns with the intuition behind the Chinese Room. The system described lacks key features EPET considers necessary for consciousness:

    *   **Embodiment and Interaction:** The room is disembodied and doesn't interact meaningfully with a world based on its "understanding."
    *   **Intrinsic Predictive Modeling:** The person follows external rules, rather than the system generating its own internal, self-organizing predictive model based on minimizing surprise through interaction.
    *   **Biological Grounding/Interoception:** The system lacks the biological context, homeostatic imperatives, and interoceptive feedback that EPET sees as grounding conscious experience, particularly affect and relevance.
    EPET suggests that consciousness is not merely about implementing the right abstract algorithm (syntax) but requires a specific kind of dynamic, embodied, predictive process realized in a suitable physical substrate (Section 6.6; cf. [@Wiese2024]). Therefore, the Chinese Room system, lacking these properties, would not be conscious according to EPET.


In conclusion, EPET interprets these classic thought experiments not as refutations of physicalism, but as highlighting the epistemic challenges arising from the first-person perspective and the nature of our phenomenal concepts, challenges that its framework aims to address naturalistically.
