# Supplementary Materials E: Potential Explanatory Advantages of EPET

*(This section elaborates on specific empirical phenomena where the unique integrative framework of EPET may offer a more direct, unified, or parsimonious explanation compared to its constituent theories (PP, GWT) in isolation or other competing integrative models.)*

EPET's specific synthesis of Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment/Interoception, non-reductive Emergentism, and an Anattā-constrained Self-Model allows it to address certain empirical findings in a particularly coherent way. Below are examples illustrating this potential explanatory power.

## E.1 Ego Dissolution under Psychedelics and Meditation

*   **Phenomenon:** Subjective reports of "ego dissolution" or a breakdown of the sense of self are common during psychedelic experiences (e.g., with psilocybin, LSD, DMT) and advanced stages of certain meditation practices (e.g., *Vipassanā* insight meditation). These experiences often involve feelings of unity with the environment, blurred self/other boundaries, and altered perception. Neuroimaging studies often correlate these states with specific changes in brain activity, notably decreased coherence or altered activity within the Default Mode Network (DMN), and changes in global functional connectivity [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014; @nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @milliere2023neural].
*   **EPET's Explanation:** EPET provides a unified account linking the neural and phenomenological aspects. It posits the sense of self arises from a dynamic, predictive self-model constrained by the Anattā principle (implying non-substantiality and plasticity) (Section 3.2). Psychedelics or meditative training are hypothesized to disrupt the stability or reduce the precision of high-level priors within this self-model. According to PP principles integrated within EPET, reducing the precision of the self-model would lead to:
    1.  **Phenomenological Ego Dissolution:** A weakened self-prior results in a less distinct subjective boundary between self and world, matching reports of unity or self-loss.
    2.  **Altered DMN Activity/Connectivity:** As the DMN is a key substrate for the self-model, reduced precision or coherence of this model naturally correlates with observed changes in DMN activity and global connectivity patterns.
    3.  **Altered Global Access (GWT Interaction):** A less dominant self-model may alter the competition for global workspace access. Self-related information may lose its privileged access (consistent with Hypothesis 3 in SM C), while bottom-up sensory information or usually suppressed internal states might gain salience, contributing to altered perceptual experiences often reported.
*   **Advantage over Alternatives:** While PP-only models can describe altered priors and GWT-only models can describe altered workspace content, EPET integrates these. Crucially, its *Anattā-constrained* view of the self *predicts* the inherent plasticity and potential for dissolution of the self-model, offering a principled reason why these states occur and linking them directly to both brain network dynamics and subjective reports within a single coherent framework derived from EPET's core principles. Theories lacking this explicit non-substantial self-model might need ad-hoc explanations for why the self is so malleable.

## E.2 Interoceptive Modulation of Exteroceptive Conscious Access

*   **Phenomenon:** Studies show that the processing of external stimuli (e.g., visual) can be modulated by the phase of the cardiac cycle or the focus on interoceptive signals. Recent work demonstrates a sustained trade-off where attention to cardiac signals attenuates visual processing [@ren2024listen]. This suggests a dynamic competition or resource allocation between internal bodily monitoring and external perception.
*   **EPET's Explanation:** EPET explains this via the interaction of embodied PP and GWT. Interoceptive signals (like cardiac afferents) are processed within the predictive hierarchy, generating prediction errors related to the body's state. When these interoceptive signals (or prediction errors) are assigned high precision (e.g., during salient phases like systole, or when attention is directed inward), they compete for access to the limited-capacity global workspace. According to EPET, the GWT integrates information relevant to the organism's overall state. High-priority internal signals related to vital functions can thus transiently "capture" the workspace or raise the threshold for unrelated external stimuli, leading to the observed suppression of exteroceptive processing. This reflects the embodied nature of consciousness in EPET, where maintaining physiological stability is a core function influencing global brain dynamics.
*   **Advantage over Alternatives:** GWT-only theories typically focus on competition between external sensory inputs or internal thoughts, often neglecting the role of ongoing, background interoceptive processing as a major player in workspace dynamics. PP-only theories can model interoceptive inference but lack the explicit GWT mechanism to explain the global trade-off and impact on *conscious access* (reportability). EPET's synthesis naturally accounts for this interplay by treating the GWT as integrating information from *both* exteroceptive and interoceptive predictive models within an embodied context.

## E.3 Neural Correlates of Consciously Felt Affective Valence

*   **Phenomenon:** The intensity of subjective emotional feeling (valence) correlates strongly with activity in brain regions processing interoceptive information, particularly the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Furthermore, neural markers of interoceptive processing, like the amplitude of the Heartbeat-Evoked Potential (HEP), have been shown to be modulated during the processing of emotional stimuli, suggesting a link between cardiac feedback processing and affect [@marshall2019affective]. This implies conscious affect is tightly linked to the brain's representation and processing of the body's internal state.
*   **EPET's Explanation:** This aligns perfectly with EPET's constitutive account of affective valence (Section 4.2). EPET posits that valence *is* the phenomenal character of interoceptive prediction errors evaluated against homeostatic/allostatic goals. The activity in insula/ACC reflects this ongoing interoceptive inference process. When interoceptive prediction errors are sufficiently precise and integrated (potentially via GWT access), they constitute a conscious feeling tone. The modulation of HEPs during emotional processing suggests that the neural integration of interoceptive signals is a key component of the conscious affective state, consistent with EPET's view of qualia as properties of the integrated process.
*   **Advantage over Alternatives:** Theories focusing solely on cognitive appraisals or behavioral outputs struggle to explain the raw *feeling* of pleasantness or unpleasantness and its intimate connection to bodily states. While embodied PP theories address this, EPET integrates it with GWT (explaining *conscious awareness* of the feeling) and offers a *constitutive* claim about qualia (the feeling *is* the evaluation process). This provides a more unified account of *conscious affect* than theories treating affect as merely informational input or a purely cognitive judgment.

## E.4 Reduced Neural Self-Bias in Long-Term Meditators

*   **Phenomenon:** Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies show that long-term practice of certain meditation techniques (especially mindfulness and related practices) is associated with functional changes in the brain, including reduced activity and connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN) during tasks involving self-reference or during resting state, compared to controls [@fox2016functional]. The DMN is strongly implicated in self-referential thought, mind-wandering, and autobiographical memory.
*   **EPET's Explanation:** EPET interprets these findings as direct evidence for the plasticity of the Anattā-constrained predictive self-model. Meditation practices, particularly those involving sustained attention to the present moment and observing thoughts and feelings without identification (deconstruction), effectively train the brain to down-regulate the precision and habitual engagement of high-level self-priors. This repeated dis-identification from the self-narrative and self-identification leads to a long-term reduction in the dominance of the self-model. The observed decrease in DMN activity reflects this learned attenuation of the neural processes realizing the habitual self-model.
*   **Advantage over Alternatives:** While other theories might simply correlate DMN activity with self-reference, EPET provides a *mechanistic* account (changes in predictive priors and precision) grounded in a *philosophical principle* (Anattā as a constraint allowing for non-substantiality and plasticity). This offers a deeper explanation for *why* meditation might specifically target and modify DMN-related self-processing, linking practice, phenomenology (reduced self-focus), and neural changes within its integrative framework. It treats the meditative state not just as an altered state, but as a state reflecting a learned modification of the very predictive architecture EPET proposes underlies the self.
