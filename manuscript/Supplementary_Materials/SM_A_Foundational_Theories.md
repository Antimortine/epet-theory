# Supplementary Materials A: Extended Background on Foundational Scientific Theories

*(This section provides more detailed background information on the core scientific theories and concepts mentioned in the main manuscript's Section 1.1, intended for readers seeking further context.)*

## A.1 Predictive Processing (PP) / Free-Energy Principle (FEP)

Predictive Processing (PP) frameworks, often grounded in the broader Free-Energy Principle (FEP), propose a fundamental principle of brain function: the brain is essentially a hierarchical inference engine or prediction machine [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013].

*   **Core Idea:** The brain constantly generates predictions (hypotheses) about the causes of its sensory inputs at multiple levels of abstraction. These top-down predictions are compared with bottom-up sensory signals. The mismatch between predictions and signals constitutes **prediction error**.
*   **Goal:** The overarching goal of the system is to **minimize long-term average prediction error** (or its information-theoretic correlate, "surprise" or "free energy"). This minimization is achieved through two primary routes:
    1.  **Perceptual Inference:** Updating internal predictive models (priors) to better match sensory data.
    2.  **Active Inference:** Performing actions that change sensory input to make it conform to predictions (e.g., moving the eyes to confirm an expected visual scene).
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Predictive models are organized hierarchically. Higher levels generate more abstract, temporally extended predictions that constrain predictions at lower levels, which deal with more concrete sensory details. Prediction errors propagate up the hierarchy, informing model updates, while predictions flow down.
*   **Precision Weighting:** Prediction errors are not treated equally. Their influence on model updating and action selection is weighted by their estimated **precision** (inverse variance or confidence). High-precision errors (deemed reliable or important) exert a stronger influence. Attention is often conceptualized within PP as the process of optimizing precision weighting [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010], effectively amplifying salient or task-relevant signals.
*   **Unifying Scope:** PP/FEP offers a potentially unifying account for a wide range of cognitive phenomena, including perception, action, learning, attention, decision-making, and, importantly for EPET, **interoception** (predictive modeling of internal bodily states) and **affective experience** (potentially arising from interoceptive prediction errors) [@sethInteroceptiveInferenceEmotion2013; @barrettTheoryConstructedEmotion2017].

## A.2 Global Workspace Theory (GWT) / Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT)

Global Workspace Theory (GWT), originally proposed by Bernard Baars and later developed into the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) by Stanislas Dehaene and colleagues, provides a cognitive architecture for understanding conscious access [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014].

*   **Core Idea:** The cognitive system features a central "global workspace"—a limited-capacity communication hub connected to numerous specialized unconscious processing modules (e.g., for perception, memory, language, motor control).
*   **Conscious Access:** Information (e.g., a perceptual representation) becomes conscious when it gains access to this workspace and is **globally broadcast** back to the specialized modules. This global availability allows the information to be flexibly used for various cognitive functions, such as verbal report, long-term memory storage, and voluntary action control.
*   **Neural Implementation (GNWT):** GNWT proposes that the global workspace is implemented by a distributed network of neurons, primarily involving long-range connections between associative cortical areas, particularly **prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)**. Access to the workspace is thought to correspond to a nonlinear "ignition" event – a sudden, large-scale, self-sustained pattern of neural activity that propagates throughout the workspace network. This ignition is often associated with specific electrophysiological markers, such as the **late P3b ERP component** and **high-frequency (gamma-band) oscillations**.
*   **Role in EPET:** GWT/GNWT provides EPET with a plausible mechanism for explaining how specific contents generated by the PP hierarchy become consciously accessed, integrated into a unified experience, stabilized over time, and made available for report and control. The interface between PP and GWT is hypothesized to involve competition between precision-weighted signals for global broadcast (as discussed in the main text, Section 3.1).
*   **Relation to Attention and Working Memory:** GWT is closely related to concepts of attention (which selects information for potential broadcast) and working memory (which maintains globally available information over time).

## A.3 Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)

Recurrent Processing Theory, primarily associated with Victor Lamme and colleagues, emphasizes the role of recurrent (feedback) connections in the cortex for generating conscious experience [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000].

*   **Core Idea:** RPT distinguishes between an initial, rapid feedforward sweep of information through the visual hierarchy (sufficient for unconscious processing) and subsequent **recurrent processing** involving feedback loops between higher and lower cortical areas. It is this sustained recurrent activity, Lamme argues, that is necessary and sufficient for phenomenal consciousness (the raw feel of experience), even if the information doesn't reach the global workspace for report.
*   **Relation to GWT:** RPT differs from GWT in that it posits phenomenal consciousness can arise from local recurrent processing within sensory hierarchies, whereas GWT typically associates consciousness (especially reportable consciousness) with later, widespread recurrent activity involving fronto-parietal networks.
*   **Relation to PP:** RPT aligns well with PP, as predictive coding inherently relies on recurrent connections for transmitting top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors. The sustained reverberation highlighted by RPT can be seen as part of the process of settling into a stable predictive interpretation of sensory input.
*   **Relevance to EPET:** EPET acknowledges the importance of recurrent processing, seeing it as a necessary component of both the PP mechanisms generating content and the GWT mechanisms enabling global access and stabilization. EPET might potentially accommodate both RPT and GWT by suggesting different levels or types of consciousness correspond to local vs. global recurrent dynamics.

## A.4 Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)

The search for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) aims to identify the minimal neural activity jointly sufficient for a specific conscious experience [@kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017].

*   **NCC Distinction:** Research typically distinguishes between:
    *   **NCC for Level (NCC-L):** Neural activity necessary for maintaining a state of consciousness or wakefulness (e.g., being awake vs. asleep or in a coma). This often involves brainstem structures (like the reticular activating system) and thalamic nuclei regulating overall cortical arousal [@parviziConsciousnessBrainstem2001; @plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982].
    *   **NCC for Content (NCC-C):** Neural activity determining the specific *content* of consciousness at a given moment (e.g., seeing a face vs. seeing a house). These correlates are thought to involve specific patterns of activity in sensory cortices (e.g., V4 for color, FFA for faces) and associative areas, often involving dynamic interactions within thalamocortical loops and potentially requiring synchronization across distributed neuronal populations [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005].
*   **Relevance to EPET:** EPET aims to provide a theoretical framework that explains *why* certain neural activities correlate with consciousness. It proposes that NCC-C correspond to the specific patterns within the globally available, integrated predictive model, while NCC-L relate to the background conditions enabling the stable operation of this complex predictive system.
