# Supplementary Materials C: Detailed Testable Hypotheses Derived from EPET

*(This section provides detailed descriptions of potentially falsifiable empirical predictions derived from the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET). These hypotheses aim to test the unique integration of EPET's core components: Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment/Interoception, Emergentist Physicalism, and the Anattā-constrained Self-Model.)*

EPET's integrative framework generates specific predictions that go beyond those derivable from its constituent theories (PP, GWT) in isolation or from alternative integrative models lacking EPET's specific philosophical commitments. Testing these hypotheses can provide empirical credence to EPET's core claims about the nature of phenomenal experience, selfhood, and conscious access.

While all hypotheses presented below aim to test core aspects of EPET, some are particularly central to probing its unique integrative claims. **Hypotheses 2, 3, and 7** directly investigate the interplay between the *Anattā*-constrained self-model, interoceptive/affective processing, and conscious access/phenomenology, aspects where EPET's synthesis offers distinctive predictions compared to less integrated or philosophically constrained frameworks. **Hypotheses 1, 4, and 5** focus more on the interaction between embodiment, precision, homeostatic relevance, and conscious processing (PP-GWT dynamics), testing the implications of EPET's embodied and emergentist stance. **Hypothesis 6** targets the specific neural basis of affective qualia. Readers interested in the core philosophical distinctions of EPET might focus initially on Hypotheses 2, 3, and 7.

**Hypothesis 1: Precision-Weighting Dissociates Qualia Intensity from Conscious Access**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET posits that the phenomenal intensity or clarity of qualia is constituted by dynamic characteristics of the underlying predictive model, such as signal stability, strength, and assigned precision (Sec 4.2), whereas conscious *access* (reportability, integration) depends on achieving global availability via GWT mechanisms (Sec 3.1). While precision influences the likelihood of global access, EPET predicts these two aspects—phenomenal intensity and access—are partially dissociable. Manipulating precision should primarily affect the subjective quality/vividness, potentially without altering the objective threshold for reportability mediated by GWT ignition. This tests the constitutive view of qualia (dependent on PP dynamics like precision) and its distinction from the access mechanism (GWT).
*   **Prediction:** In psychophysical tasks (e.g., near-threshold visual detection, attentional blink), experimentally manipulating attentional focus (top-down precision) or neuromodulatory tone (e.g., cholinergic enhancement, bottom-up precision) directed at a stimulus should modulate subjective ratings of its *vividness* or *clarity* even when objective detection accuracy or ERP markers of global access (like P3b latency/amplitude) remain constant or change non-proportionally. For instance, a highly attended but brief stimulus might be reported as phenomenally vivid despite failing to trigger a full P3b (missing conscious report), or a weakly attended stimulus triggering a P3b might be reported as phenomenally dim.
*   **Methods:** Psychophysics (subjective rating scales for vividness/clarity alongside detection tasks), EEG/MEG (measuring precision-related neural signals like alpha suppression or gamma power, and access-related signals like P3b), pharmacology/neurostimulation (to modulate precision).
*   **Falsification:** Subjective intensity/vividness ratings always co-vary perfectly with objective measures of conscious access (reportability, P3b amplitude). It proves impossible to manipulate phenomenal intensity without proportionally affecting access thresholds, challenging EPET's distinction between qualia constitution (via PP precision) and conscious access (via GWT).


**Hypothesis 2: Interoceptive Prediction Errors Directly Shape Affective Valence Qualia**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET proposes a specific constitutive account for affective valence (pleasant/unpleasant feeling tone) as the phenomenal character of the system's ongoing evaluation of its interoceptive prediction errors relative to homeostatic/allostatic goals (Sec 4.2). Successfully minimizing predicted interoceptive errors feels intrinsically positive; failure or large errors feel negative. This directly links a core type of qualia to embodied predictive regulation.
*   **Prediction:** Inducing unexpected, non-volitional interoceptive prediction errors (e.g., via unexpected changes in respiratory load, false physiological feedback like inaccurate heart rate, mild caloric vestibular stimulation affecting balance predictions) should systematically bias the reported affective valence of concurrently presented neutral stimuli (e.g., images, sounds). The magnitude and direction (positive/negative) of the valence shift should correlate with the magnitude and sign (better or worse than predicted) of the interoceptive prediction error, potentially measurable via physiological markers (HRV, EDA, pupil dilation) or neural activity in interoceptive cortices (insula, ACC). This effect should be specific to valence, potentially occurring without impairing cognitive processing (e.g., recognition) of the neutral stimuli.
*   **Methods:** Psychophysiology (ECG, respiration, EDA), fMRI/EEG (focusing on insula, ACC), psychophysics (valence rating scales for neutral stimuli presented during interoceptive manipulation), false feedback paradigms.
*   **Falsification:** Induced interoceptive prediction errors do not systematically alter affective valence ratings of neutral stimuli, or only produce non-specific arousal effects without the predicted directional bias (positive/negative). Affective valence proves independent of the current state of interoceptive inference, challenging EPET's embodied, predictive account of affect.


**Hypothesis 3: Self-Model Disruption Selectively Alters Global Workspace Integration of Self-Relevant Content**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET's self-model is a dynamic construct constrained by *Anattā* (no-self), acting as a high-level prior in the PP hierarchy (Sec 3.2). Perturbing this self-model (reducing its stability or precision, e.g., via meditation, psychedelics, or TMS to DMN nodes) should selectively alter how self-related information competes for and is integrated within the global workspace (GWT). EPET uniquely predicts an *asymmetric* effect: reduced self-model precision should decrease the privileged access of self-relevant stimuli while potentially *increasing* the salience or phenomenal clarity of non-self stimuli due to released processing resources.
*   **Prediction:** Inducing states of "ego dissolution" or self-model perturbation (validated by subjective scales like EDI and neural markers like reduced DMN coherence) should lead to: (a) Reduced neural responses (e.g., P3b amplitude, fronto-parietal connectivity) specifically to self-relevant stimuli (e.g., participant's own name or face) compared to other salient stimuli. (b) Potentially enhanced subjective ratings of vividness or novelty for non-self stimuli presented during the perturbed state. (c) Impaired performance on tasks requiring stable self-representation (e.g., complex perspective-taking, autobiographical coherence judgments).
*   **Methods:** EEG/fMRI (measuring ERPs like P3b, network connectivity like DMN coherence), validated ASC induction protocols (meditation, controlled psychedelic administration), subjective report questionnaires (EDI, 5D-ASC), behavioral tasks targeting self-representation, potentially rTMS targeting DMN hubs.
*   **Falsification:** States of ego dissolution affect global processing non-selectively (e.g., general reduction in attention or P3b amplitude for all stimuli), or self-relevant stimuli retain privileged access despite subjective reports and neural markers of self-model disruption. This would challenge EPET's specific claim about the functional role of the *Anattā*-constrained self-model in modulating GWT access.


**Hypothesis 4: Embodied Predictive Congruence Amplifies Perceptual Qualia Precision**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET emphasizes embodiment, suggesting that the integration of congruent multisensory and proprioceptive/interoceptive signals within the predictive model enhances the precision of the overall perceptual hypothesis. Higher precision, according to EPET (Sec 4.2), constitutes greater phenomenal intensity or clarity. Therefore, conditions enhancing body-environment predictive congruence should lead to subjectively clearer or more stable percepts.
*   **Prediction:** In paradigms manipulating multisensory bodily congruence (e.g., rubber hand illusion, virtual reality body-swapping, visuomotor synchrony tasks), conditions with high congruence (e.g., synchronous stroking/movement) should result in higher subjective ratings of perceptual *vividness*, *clarity*, or *stability* for the relevant modality (e.g., the visual appearance of the rubber hand, the felt location of touch) compared to asynchronous/incongruent conditions, even if the low-level sensory input is matched. This amplification of subjective quality should correlate with neural markers of increased precision (e.g., reduced neural variability or enhanced synchrony in relevant sensory or integrative areas).
*   **Methods:** VR/AR setups, rubber hand illusion paradigms, visuomotor tasks, psychophysics (subjective rating scales for clarity/vividness/stability), EEG/fMRI (measuring neural variability, synchrony).
*   **Falsification:** Subjective perceptual clarity/stability is unaffected by the degree of bodily congruence, or changes are solely attributable to attentional capture rather than enhanced precision of the integrated embodied model. This would challenge EPET's emphasis on embodied congruence as a factor constitutively shaping qualia intensity via precision.


**Hypothesis 5: Homeostatic State Gates Global Conscious Access Threshold**

*   **EPET Rationale:** As an embodied theory grounded in principles related to FEP, EPET views consciousness as serving adaptive regulation. It predicts that pressing homeostatic needs (signaled by high-precision interoceptive prediction errors) should prioritize internal regulation, potentially by raising the threshold for non-urgent external information to gain access to the limited-capacity global workspace (GWT).
*   **Prediction:** Inducing mild homeostatic challenges (e.g., thirst, hunger, slight thermal discomfort within safe limits) should increase the perceptual threshold for detecting or reporting unrelated, near-threshold external stimuli compared to a sated/comfortable baseline condition. This could manifest as lower accuracy in detection tasks, delayed reaction times for conscious report, or reduced amplitude/delayed latency of GWT-related neural markers like the P3b ERP component for identical external stimuli. The effect should be specific to conscious access, potentially leaving pre-conscious processing (e.g., earlier ERPs like N1/P2) unaffected.
*   **Methods:** Psychophysics (threshold detection tasks, signal detection theory measures), EEG (measuring ERPs like P3b), controlled induction of mild homeostatic challenges (e.g., water deprivation for a short period, controlled temperature changes), subjective reports of internal state (thirst, hunger scales).
*   **Falsification:** Mild homeostatic challenges have no effect on conscious access thresholds for unrelated stimuli, or only induce non-specific effects like general slowing or reduced arousal. This would challenge EPET's claim that the embodied need for homeostatic regulation dynamically gates GWT access for external information.


**Hypothesis 6: Insula Disruption Dissociates Affective Valence Qualia from Conscious Access/Identification**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET specifically links affective valence qualia to interoceptive prediction error processing, with the anterior insula being a key neural hub for interoceptive awareness and integration. Therefore, disrupting activity in the insula should selectively impair the phenomenal feeling tone (pleasantness/unpleasantness) associated with a stimulus, potentially without affecting the ability to consciously perceive or identify the stimulus itself. This tests the proposed specific role of interoceptive PP in constituting valence qualia.
*   **Prediction:** Non-invasive brain stimulation (e.g., TMS or tDCS) targeting the anterior insula should selectively reduce the intensity of subjective valence ratings (e.g., ratings of pleasantness for positive images or unpleasantness for negative images/sounds) compared to sham stimulation or stimulation of a control site. However, this modulation of affective qualia should occur without a corresponding impairment in the accuracy or speed of identifying or categorizing the stimuli themselves (i.e., conscious access and content identification remain intact).
*   **Methods:** TMS/tDCS targeting anterior insula, fMRI (to confirm targeting), behavioral tasks involving valence ratings and stimulus identification/categorization, subjective reports.
*   **Falsification:** Insula stimulation affects general arousal or cognitive performance non-specifically, or it impairs both valence ratings and stimulus identification equally. Alternatively, valence ratings remain unaffected by insula disruption. This would challenge EPET's specific hypothesis linking affective valence qualia to interoceptive processing potentially mediated by the insula.


**Hypothesis 7: Experienced Meditators Exhibit Attenuated Neural Correlates of the Predictive Self-Model**

*   **EPET Rationale:** EPET's self-model is dynamic and non-substantial, constrained by *Anattā*. Practices aimed at deconstructing the self (like *Vipassanā* meditation) should, according to EPET, lead to long-term plasticity in the predictive self-model, reducing the precision or dominance of self-related priors. This should manifest as attenuated neural markers typically associated with self-processing.
*   **Prediction:** Compared to matched non-meditator controls, long-term practitioners of insight/non-dual meditation traditions will exhibit reduced differential neural activity when processing self-relevant vs. other-relevant stimuli. This could include: (a) Reduced activation or altered connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) during self-referential tasks [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015]. (b) Smaller amplitude differences in ERP components associated with self-relevance (e.g., P3b or later components evoked by seeing one's own face or name versus a familiar other's). These reductions in neural self-bias should correlate with behavioral or questionnaire measures of reduced self-centeredness or increased non-dual awareness. Basic sensory processing should remain intact or even be enhanced.
*   **Methods:** fMRI/EEG during self-referential tasks (e.g., own vs. other face/name recognition, trait judgments), comparison between long-term meditators and controls, validated questionnaires (e.g., decentering, non-dual awareness scales).
*   **Falsification:** Long-term meditation practice shows no specific effect on neural markers of self-processing, or effects are non-specific (e.g., general changes in attention networks). Neural self-bias remains strong despite extensive practice aimed at deconstructing the self. This would challenge the link EPET makes between the *Anattā* principle, the plasticity of the predictive self-model, and observable neural correlates.
