# Supplementary Materials C: Detailed Testable Hypotheses of EPET

*(This section provides the full, detailed descriptions of the testable hypotheses derived from the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), as summarized in the main manuscript's Section 8.4)*

A key strength of the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) lies in its capacity to bridge philosophical inquiry with empirical science by generating specific, potentially falsifiable hypotheses. These predictions arise directly from EPET’s **unique philosophical synthesis** of Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Embodiment, and a Buddhist-informed processual Self-Model. They are designed not merely to test the constituent parts in isolation, but to probe the **explanatory power and coherence of their integration** as proposed by EPET. Successfully testing these hypotheses would therefore lend empirical credence to EPET’s core claims about the nature of phenomenal experience, selfhood, and conscious access, offering a pathway to validate its distinctive theoretical contributions:

**Prediction 1: Dynamic Modulation of Exteroceptive Conscious Access by Interoceptive Prediction Error and Precision.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** EPET posits that conscious access to exteroceptive stimuli, mediated by Global Workspace (GWT) mechanisms, is not solely determined by external factors but is dynamically modulated by the organism's ongoing interoceptive state. Specifically, high-precision interoceptive prediction errors (reflecting significant PP-based valence/arousal signals such as homeostatic imbalance or threat) are hypothesized to raise the GWT access threshold for concurrently processed, non-homeostatically-relevant external stimuli. This prediction uniquely arises from EPET's synthesis of embodied interoceptive PP (regulating internal milieu and generating affect) with GWT (mediating conscious access for external information).
    
-   **Prediction:** In tasks like the attentional blink or near-threshold perception, inducing a mild, controlled interoceptive challenge (e.g., unexpected dyspnea, cold pressor test, or caloric vestibular stimulation, carefully controlled for safety and ethics) should, compared to a neutral baseline, **increase the perceptual threshold** (e.g., delayed/reduced P3b amplitude, lower report accuracy) for task-irrelevant but physically salient exteroceptive stimuli. Conversely, access may be enhanced for stimuli perceived as relevant to mitigating the interoceptive challenge. Subjective affect/anxiety and physiological markers of interoception should mediate these effects, with corresponding modulations in GWT-related (fronto-parietal) and interoceptive (insula/ACC) network activity.
    
-   **Methods:** EEG/fMRI, psychophysiology (ECG, respiration, EDA), psychophysics (attentional blink, masking paradigms), subjective reports (valence, anxiety, interoceptive awareness scales).
    
-   **Falsification:** The threshold for conscious access to external stimuli remains unchanged despite significant and subjectively reported manipulations of interoceptive prediction error and affective state; or, the interoceptive state only affects overall arousal/performance non-specifically, without the predicted interaction with stimulus relevance or specific GWT-related neural markers. This would challenge EPET's proposed integration of interoceptive PP modulation with GWT access mechanisms.

**Prediction 2: Modulation of Affective Valence by the Predictive Self-Model's Causal Attributions of Interoceptive Signals.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** EPET proposes that subjective affective valence (a core type of qualia arising from interoceptive prediction errors via PP) is not a direct readout of bodily signals but is significantly co-constituted by the **predictive self-model**. Specifically, the causal attributions made by this Anattā-consistent self-model (a dynamic PP construct)—interpreting a physiological change as internally or externally caused—should fundamentally alter the phenomenal character of the resulting affective experience. This tests EPET’s unique claim about the self-model's active role in shaping interoceptively-grounded qualia, integrating interoceptive PP with self-modeling PP.
    
-   **Prediction:** In ambiguous physiological feedback paradigms (e.g., false heart-rate feedback or manipulated skin conductance feedback), experimentally manipulating participants' causal attributions for a perceived physiological change (e.g., "This change is due to your internal emotional reaction to the stimuli" vs. "This change is due to the properties of the equipment/external stimulus") should lead to **quantifiably different subjective valence and arousal ratings** for the identical manipulated signal. Attributing the signal to a **'self'-related cause** is predicted to yield more intense and qualitatively distinct affect (e.g., more intense negative valence if the signal is aversive and self-attributed) and specific neural correlates (e.g., in insula, ACC, mPFC, and DMN regions) compared to external attributions. The degree of DMN engagement or connectivity changes might correlate with the strength of this self-attribution effect.
    
-   **Methods:** fMRI/EEG, psychophysiology (HRV, EDA), false feedback paradigms, validated scales for subjective valence/arousal and self-consciousness, potentially TMS to modulate DMN activity.
    
-   **Falsification:** Subjective valence and arousal ratings are solely determined by the magnitude and direction of the manipulated physiological signal, irrespective of the experimentally induced causal attribution. No significant differences in subjective reports or associated neural correlates (particularly in self-processing and interoceptive networks) are found based on the attribution manipulation. This would challenge EPET's claim that the predictive self-model actively shapes the phenomenal character of interoceptively-grounded affective qualia.

**Prediction 3: Impact of Predictive Self-Model Perturbations on Perceptual Stability, Integration, and Global Access.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** EPET proposes that the stability and precision of the **predictive self-model** (a high-level PP construct, whose non-substantial nature is informed by the Anattā principle) function as crucial top-down priors that stabilize lower-level perceptual inference and integration. Consequently, experimentally induced perturbations to this self-model's coherence or precision (e.g., via specific meditative practices, controlled administration of psychedelics, or non-invasive brain stimulation targeting key self-processing network nodes like the DMN) should decrease the efficacy of top-down stabilization of perceptual interpretations. This would manifest as measurable changes in perceptual binding, the dynamics of bistable perception, and potentially allow weaker, ambiguous, or unusual sensory interpretations to gain **global access** (GWT). This hypothesis tests EPET’s specific integration of self-modeling PP, perceptual PP, and GWT mechanisms.
    
-   **Prediction:** Inducing states of significant self-model alteration (e.g., "ego dissolution" following intensive mindfulness/insight meditation, under controlled low-dose psychedelic administration, or via rTMS targeting DMN hubs like the mPFC or PCC) is predicted to result in: (a) **decreased stability in bistable perception** (e.g., faster switching rates for Necker cube, binocular rivalry); (b) potentially **increased susceptibility to illusory conjunctions** in feature binding tasks; and (c) altered report thresholds for ambiguous stimuli. These perceptual effects should correlate with validated subjective measures of self-model alteration (e.g., Ego Dissolution Inventory) and neurophysiological markers of reduced self-model precision or DMN integrity (e.g., decreased DMN coherence in fMRI/EEG).
    
-   **Methods:** EEG/fMRI, psychophysics (bistable perception, feature binding tasks, signal detection tasks with ambiguous stimuli), validated meditation/ASC induction protocols, subjective report questionnaires (EDI, 5D-ASC), potentially rTMS.
    
-   **Falsification:** States of significant self-model alteration (as measured by subjective reports and neural markers) show no systematic or specific effects on perceptual stability, integration, or access dynamics beyond non-specific changes (e.g., general decrease in attention or arousal). Perceptual changes, if any, do not correlate with the degree of self-model disruption. This would challenge EPET's proposed role of the predictive self-model as a high-level prior that actively shapes and stabilizes perception and its access to the global workspace.

**Prediction 4: The Modulatory Role of the Phenomenal Sense of Agency (as a Self-Model Construct) on Active Inference and Perceptual Stabilization.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** EPET proposes that the efficacy of embodied action (Active Inference) in resolving perceptual uncertainty and stabilizing conscious percepts (a PP mechanism) is modulated by the **phenomenal sense of agency**. This sense of agency, itself an output of the predictive self-model arising from the successful prediction of sensory consequences of self-generated actions, is hypothesized to enhance prediction error minimization. Consequently, actions performed with a strong, coherent sense of agency should lead to more stable, globally accessed (GWT) percepts than identical physical actions performed passively or with an experimentally reduced or disrupted sense of agency. This tests EPET’s integration of Active Inference (PP/Embodiment), self-modeling for agency (PP), and GWT-mediated perceptual stabilization.
    
-   **Prediction:** In tasks requiring subtle motor actions (e.g., saccadic eye movements, fine manual adjustments, joystick control) to disambiguate a noisy, ambiguous, or bistable stimulus, experimentally manipulating the perceived sense of agency over those actions (e.g., by introducing slight, unpredictable delays or distortions in action-feedback loops, or by using instructions that bias agency attribution) will modulate perceptual outcomes. Specifically, a **higher reported sense of agency** is predicted to correlate with **faster perceptual resolution, greater stability of the chosen percept, and increased confidence in the percept**, even when the physical parameters of the action and the resulting sensory information are closely matched across conditions. Neural markers of agency (e.g., attenuation of the N1 component of sensory evoked potentials for self-caused sensations, specific parietal or pre-motor cortical activity) should correlate with both subjective agency ratings and the efficacy of active perceptual inference.
    
-   **Methods:** Motion tracking (eye-tracking, hand/joystick tracking), EEG/MEG (for sensory attenuation and agency-related potentials), psychophysics (perceptual stabilization/disambiguation tasks with active components), agency manipulation paradigms (e.g., intentional binding tasks, feedback distortion), subjective reports (sense of agency scales, confidence ratings).
    
-   **Falsification:** Perceptual stabilization and resolution depend solely on the physical parameters of the action and the resulting sensory input, irrespective of the manipulated or reported sense of agency. No significant correlation is found between neural or subjective markers of agency and the effectiveness of active inference in shaping conscious perception. This would challenge EPET's claim that the self-model's agency component plays a functional role in the efficacy of embodied predictive processing and perceptual stabilization.

**Prediction 5: Neurodynamic Signatures of PP-GWT Interface for Conscious Access.**

-   **EPET Hypothesis:** EPET predicts that the critical transition of information from non-conscious Predictive Processing (PP) hierarchies to a state of conscious access via the Global Workspace (GWT) is characterized by specific, measurable neurodynamic signatures. These signatures, reflecting the successful global broadcast of high-precision prediction errors or stabilized high-level predictions, are hypothesized to involve a dynamic interplay of neural oscillations (e.g., between lower-frequency alpha/beta bands for top-down predictive modulation and higher-frequency gamma bands for bottom-up error signaling) that orchestrates information flow across distributed cortical networks. While individual neurodynamic markers are studied in various contexts, EPET offers a specific interpretation of their collective role as indicators of the dynamic PP-GWT interface crucial for conscious access.
    
-   **Prediction:**
    1.  **Oscillatory Dynamics:** Conscious access to a stimulus (i.e., its "ignition" in the GWT) will be reliably preceded or accompanied by:
        *   A transient **decrease in alpha/beta power** in relevant cortical networks (e.g., fronto-parietal and sensory areas involved), reflecting a release from top-down predictive inhibition or a shift in attentional state facilitating bottom-up processing [@bastosLayerRhythmSpecificity2020; @xiongPropofolmediatedLossConsciousness2024].
        *   A concurrent or immediately subsequent **increase in gamma-band power and/or synchrony** within and between task-relevant sensory and associative (e.g., fronto-parietal) cortices, reflecting the propagation of prediction errors or the formation and broadcast of a conscious percept [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999; @mashourConsciousProcessingGlobal2020].
        *   Specific patterns of **cross-frequency coupling** (e.g., phase-amplitude coupling between theta/alpha and gamma) might emerge as a marker of hierarchical information integration and broadcast.
    2.  **Late ERP Components:** The P3b component (or analogous late, widespread ERPs) will be strongly associated with the global availability of information, reflecting the large-scale neural recruitment characteristic of GWT ignition [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005]. The amplitude and latency of P3b should correlate with the strength/precision of the signal achieving global access.
    3.  **Connectivity:** Functional connectivity (e.g., measured by coherence or Granger causality) between posterior (sensory) and anterior (fronto-parietal) regions in gamma and/or beta bands will be transiently enhanced during conscious access, reflecting the broadcasting process.
    
-   **Methods:** High-density EEG/MEG for excellent temporal resolution of oscillations and ERPs; fMRI for spatial localization of involved networks (though with lower temporal resolution for oscillatory dynamics). Paradigms that parametrically vary stimulus visibility or conscious reportability (e.g., attentional blink, masking, threshold perception tasks, no-report paradigms where applicable). Advanced signal processing techniques for analyzing oscillatory power, synchrony, cross-frequency coupling, and effective connectivity.
    
-   **Falsification:**
    1.  Conscious access is not reliably associated with the predicted oscillatory changes (e.g., no consistent alpha/beta suppression or gamma enhancement, or opposite patterns are observed).
    2.  Late ERP components like P3b are found to be dissociable from conscious report or global availability under conditions predicted by EPET to require them.
    3.  No significant enhancement of relevant posterior-anterior connectivity is observed during conscious access, or connectivity patterns contradict a broadcasting model.
    A failure to find these neurodynamic signatures would challenge EPET's proposed mechanistic link between PP-generated content achieving global availability via GWT and specific oscillatory/ERP markers of this process.
