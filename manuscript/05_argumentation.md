# 5. Argumentation and Empirical Support for EPET

EPET aims for internal coherence, empirical correspondence, and conceptual consistency. This section provides argumentation supporting EPET's central theses, linking them to contemporary scientific research and highlighting their compatibility with key Buddhist philosophical principles that guided the theory's development (as outlined in Section 1.3).

## 5.1. Support for Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

**5.1.1. Emergence and Processuality:**
EPET's view of consciousness as an emergent, dynamic process finds broad support.
-   **Scientific data:** Consciousness demonstrably depends on the functioning brain, exhibits gradual development, and relies on dynamic neural activity, with its level often correlating with measures of neural complexity and integration, consistent with an emergent process view [@plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005; @trevarthenInfantIntersubjectivityResearch2001; @varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001; @tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This resonates with the Buddhist understanding of consciousness as a conditioned, impermanent flow (reflecting *Anicca* and *Paṭiccasamuppāda*).

**5.1.2. Embodiment:**
The thesis linking consciousness to the body and action is well-supported.
-   **Scientific data:** Interoception is crucial for emotions and self-awareness, enactivist approaches highlight perception as action-oriented, and bodily states clearly influence conscious experience, supporting the idea that consciousness is not merely brain-bound [@craigHowYouFeel2009; @varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004; @damasioDescartesError2006].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This finds a parallel in the Buddhist phenomenological emphasis on *rūpa* (materiality/body) and *vedanā* (feeling tone linked to bodily states).

**5.1.3. Predictive Modeling (PP) as the Core:**
Using PP as the core mechanism relies on its significant explanatory power.
-   **Scientific data:** PP successfully explains diverse perceptual and cognitive phenomena, and neural evidence for prediction and error signals (e.g., Mismatch Negativity) is accumulating [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** The active, constructive nature of PP offers a conceptual parallel to *saṅkhāra* (mental formations actively shaping experience).

**5.1.4. Content of Consciousness = Content of the Model:**
The idea that we perceive the model's output, not raw data, is supported by:
-   **Scientific data:** PP compellingly explains phenomena like hallucinations, and NCCs for specific content often map to brain areas generating high-level representations [@sterzerPredictiveCodingAccount2018; @tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This is harmonious with the role attributed to *saññā* (perception/conceptualization) in constructing our perceived world-model.

**5.1.5. Role of Prediction Errors and Precision (Attention):**
The functional roles ascribed to prediction errors and precision are empirically supported.
-   **Scientific data:** Specific neural responses correlate with prediction errors, and attention demonstrably modulates neural responses consistently with precision weighting [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007; @feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** Precision modulation in PP finds a functional parallel in Buddhist descriptions of mental factors directing focus (e.g., *manasikāra*), without implying a direct mapping.

**5.1.6. Global Availability (GWT) for Integration and Access:**
Using GWT for integration and access is grounded in its empirical support.
-   **Scientific data:** Conscious perception correlates with late, widespread neural activation ("ignition," P3b) involving prefrontal-parietal networks, consistent with GWT [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. Studies of split-brain patients and mindfulness meditation (modulating attention networks and DMN connectivity) further support the role of large-scale integration and dynamic precision weighting for conscious access and state modulation [@gazzanigaCerebralSpecializationInterhemispheric2000; @lutzAttentionRegulationMonitoring2008; @tangNeuroscienceMindfulnessMeditation2015].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** GWT offers a plausible architecture for integrating diverse experiential aspects (analyzed in Buddhism via the *khandhas*) into unified consciousness (a function of *viññāṇa*).

## 5.2. Support for Thesis 2: Integration and Unity of Experience without a Substantial "Self"

**5.2.1. Unity as Functional Integration:**
Explaining unity via dynamic integration avoids positing a central self.
-   **Scientific data:** Neural synchronization, recurrent processing, and global availability (GWT) are proposed mechanisms for solving the 'binding problem' [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999; @lammeDistinctModesVision2000; @baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993; @treismanBindingProblem1996].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This functional explanation of unity is fully compatible with the core Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā** (no-self).

**5.2.2. Absence of a Substantial “Self” (Anattā):** EPET's rejection of a substantial self aligns with both science and Buddhism.
-   **Scientific data:** Neuroscience finds no single brain center for a "self"; self-related processing involves distributed networks like the DMN [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015]. **The DMN's role is increasingly interpreted within Predictive Processing frameworks as potentially implementing high-level generative models or priors concerning the broader context or the narrative self, used to predictively guide ongoing processing [@Stawarczyk2021Default; @TranThe2022Hyperactivity].** EPET further predicts and explains findings that long-term meditation practices aimed at deconstructing the self-concept correlate with reduced DMN activity [@fox2016functional]. This is interpreted within EPET not merely as a correlation, but as evidence for the plasticity of the *Anattā*-constrained self-model, where training alters the precision of self-related priors (see Supplementary Materials E.4 for details).
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This is a direct articulation of the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā**.

**5.2.3. "Self” as a Construct of Self-Modeling:** The view of the self as a dynamic construct of predictive self-modeling is supported by converging evidence.
-   **Scientific data:** Theoretical development of self-modeling within PP is advancing [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. Neuropsychological conditions (e.g., anosognosia) and ASC studies reporting "ego dissolution" support the constructed and plastic nature of the self-model [@fotopoulouImplicitAwarenessAnosognosia2010; @nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014]. EPET offers a particularly unified explanation for such ego dissolution phenomena observed under psychedelics or in deep meditation. The theory posits that these states involve a significant reduction in the precision or coherence of the predictive self-model, potentially linked to altered DMN activity. This weakening of the *Anattā*-constrained self-model directly predicts the reported subjective experience of blurred self/world boundaries and altered access for self-relevant information, integrating neural and phenomenological data within a single framework derived from EPET's core principles (see Supplementary Materials E.1 for details).
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This resonates with the role of *saṅkhāra* in constructing the sense of a persistent "I".

## 5.3. Support for the Explanation of Qualia (Section 4)

**5.3.1. Qualia as Properties of the Process:**
Viewing qualia as intrinsic properties of the modeling process finds support.
-   **Scientific data:** Specific qualia reliably correlate with activity in specific neural systems (e.g., V4/color, insula/affect). The observed plasticity of qualia during ASCs (e.g., psychedelic states showing increased neural entropy and altered phenomenology, explained in EPET by re-weighted precision signals) supports the idea that qualia reflect the *current state* of the modeling process [@zekiVisionBrain1993; @craigHowYouFeel2009; @carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014].
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This is harmonious with a Buddhist phenomenological view of qualitative aspects of experience (e.g., *vedanā*, *saññā*) as characteristics of the dependently arisen process of experience itself.

Furthermore, EPET's framework generates specific predictions. For instance, TMS disruption of DMN nodes [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015] should, per EPET's Thesis 2, impair tasks requiring stable predictive self-modeling (e.g., personality judgments, autobiographical coherence) more than tasks relying on external sensory processing, with impairment magnitude correlating with TMS parameters.

**5.3.2. Dimensions of Qualia (Specificity, Intensity, Valence):**
Mapping phenomenal dimensions to process parameters is plausible.
-   **Scientific data:** Specificity correlates with activity patterns/locations; intensity with signal amplitude/synchrony/precision; valence with interoceptive/limbic network activity evaluating bodily states and relevance.
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This mapping finds a conceptual parallel in the analysis of experience into the *khandhas*, where different aggregates contribute different dimensions (e.g., *saññā* to specificity, *vedanā* to valence).

## 5.4. Section Conclusion
This overview demonstrates that EPET's central theses are grounded in scientific findings and integrate leading theoretical models (PP, GWT, Embodiment), while also showing conceptual resonance with fundamental Buddhist principles (Anattā, Anicca, Paṭiccasamuppāda, khandhas). This convergence suggests EPET's potential heuristic value and plausibility.
