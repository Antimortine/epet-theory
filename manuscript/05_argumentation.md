# 5. Argumentation and Empirical Support for EPET

EPET aims for internal coherence, empirical correspondence, and conceptual consistency. This section provides argumentation supporting EPET's central theses, demonstrating their links to contemporary scientific research and compatibility with key Buddhist principles, which guided the theory's development.

## 5.1. Support for Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

**5.1.1. Emergence and Processuality:**
EPET's view of consciousness as an emergent, dynamic process finds broad support.
*   **Scientific data:** Consciousness demonstrably depends on the functioning brain (lesion/anesthesia data [@plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005]), develops gradually [@trevarthenInfantIntersubjectivityResearch2001], and relies on dynamic neural activity (EEG/MEG showing complex patterns [@varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001]). Furthermore, levels of consciousness correlate with measures of neural complexity and integration [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016], consistent with an emergent process view rather than a fundamental property.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This aligns directly with ***Anicca*** (impermanence), viewing consciousness as a constantly changing flow, and ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** (dependent origination), where consciousness arises conditionally based on other factors, not as a static entity [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].

**5.1.2. Embodiment:**
The thesis linking consciousness to the body and action is well-supported.
*   **Scientific data:** Interoception is crucial for emotions and self-awareness [@craigHowYouFeel2009]; enactivist approaches emphasize perception as action-oriented [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004]; bodily states clearly influence conscious experience [@damasioDescartesError2006]. This supports the idea that consciousness is not merely brain-bound.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Corresponds to the importance of ***Rūpa*** (materiality/body) as one of the five aggregates and the centrality of ***Vedanā*** (feeling/valence), which is often tied to bodily states, in structuring experience [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.3. Predictive Modeling (PP) as the Core:**
Using PP as the core mechanism relies on its significant explanatory power.
*   **Scientific data:** PP successfully explains various perceptual phenomena (illusions, expectation effects), action control, and attention mechanisms [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. Neural evidence for prediction and error signals (e.g., Mismatch Negativity - MMN) is accumulating [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** The active, constructive nature of PP resonates with the role of ***Saṅkhāra*** (mental formations/fabrications) in shaping experience [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.4. Content of Consciousness = Content of the Model:**
The idea that we perceive the model's output, not raw data, is supported by:
*   **Scientific data:** PP provides compelling explanations for phenomena like hallucinations (as strong priors overriding sensory evidence) [@sterzerPredictiveCodingAccount2018]. The neural correlates of specific conscious content often map onto brain areas involved in generating high-level representations or models [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This aligns with the role of ***Saññā*** (perception/recognition/conceptualization) in classifying and interpreting sensory input based on past experience, effectively contributing to the 'model' we perceive [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.5. Role of Prediction Errors and Precision (Attention):**
The functional roles ascribed to prediction errors and precision are empirically supported.
*   **Scientific data:** Specific neural responses correlate with prediction errors [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007]. Attention demonstrably modulates neural responses in ways consistent with precision weighting [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010], prioritizing certain information streams.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** The mechanism of modulating precision aligns well with the function of ***Manasikāra*** (attention/mental application) in directing and focusing the mind [@wallaceAttentionRevolutionUnlocking2006].

**5.1.6. Global Availability (GWT) for Integration and Access:**
Using GWT for integration and access is grounded in its empirical support.
*   **Scientific data:** Conscious perception correlates with late, widespread neural activation ("ignition," P3b component), involving prefrontal-parietal networks, consistent with broadcasting in a global workspace [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. Split-brain studies highlight the role of large-scale integration for unified conscious access [@gazzanigaCerebralSpecializationInterhemispheric2000].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** GWT offers a plausible neural basis for how diverse aspects of experience, analyzed via the ***Khandhas***, become integrated into the unified field of moment-to-moment consciousness (***Viññāṇa***) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

## 5.2. Support for Thesis 2: Integration and Unity of Experience without a Substantial "Self"

**5.2.1. Unity as Functional Integration:**
Explaining unity via dynamic integration avoids positing a central self.
*   **Scientific data:** Neural synchronization [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999], recurrent processing [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], and global availability (GWT) [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] are proposed mechanisms for solving the 'binding problem' (integrating features into unified percepts) [@treismanBindingProblem1996].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This functional explanation of unity is fully compatible with the core doctrine of ***Anattā*** (no-self).

**5.2.2. Absence of a Substantial "Self" (*Anattā*):**
EPET's rejection of a substantial self aligns with both science and Buddhism.
*   **Scientific data:** Neuroscience finds no single brain center corresponding to a "self"; self-related processing involves distributed networks like the Default Mode Network (DMN) [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This directly corresponds to the fundamental doctrine of ***Anattā*** [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @collinsSelflessPersonsImagery1982].

**5.2.3. "Self" as a Construct of Self-Modeling (PP + *Saṅkhāra*):**
The view of the self as a dynamic construct of predictive self-modeling is supported by converging evidence.
*   **Scientific data:** Theoretical development of self-modeling within the PP framework is advancing [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. Neuropsychological conditions like anosognosia demonstrate dissociations in self-awareness [@fotopoulouImplicitAwarenessAnosognosia2010]. Strikingly, ASC studies report experiences of **ego dissolution**, interpreted as temporary disruption of self-models, under psychedelics or deep meditation [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This resonates strongly with the role of ***Saṅkhāra*** in constructing mental formations, including the sense of a persistent "I," and explains why this sense can feel illusory yet compelling [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

## 5.3. Support for the Explanation of Qualia (Section 4)

**5.3.1. Qualia as Properties of the Process:**
Viewing qualia as intrinsic properties of the modeling process finds support.
*   **Scientific data:** Specific qualia reliably correlate with activity in specific neural systems (e.g., V4/color [@zekiVisionBrain1993], insula/affect [@craigHowYouFeel2009]). The observed **plasticity of qualia** during ASCs [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014] supports the idea that qualia reflect the *current state* of the modeling process, rather than being fixed entities.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This view aligns with understanding the phenomenal qualities associated with ***Vedanā*** (valence) and ***Saññā*** (recognition) as characteristics of the dependently arisen (**Paṭiccasamuppāda**) process of experience itself.

**5.3.2. Dimensions of Qualia (Specificity, Intensity, Valence):**
Mapping phenomenal dimensions to process parameters is plausible.
*   **Scientific data:** Specificity correlates with activity patterns/locations; intensity often correlates with signal amplitude/synchrony/precision; valence strongly correlates with activity in interoceptive and limbic networks involved in evaluating bodily states and relevance. [Further specific references could strengthen this, but the general correlations are established].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** This mapping corresponds well with the traditional analysis of experience into the ***Khandhas***, where different aggregates contribute different dimensions (e.g., Saññā - specificity, Vedanā - valence) to the overall conscious moment [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

## 5.4. Section Conclusion

This overview demonstrates that EPET's central theses are not mere speculations but are grounded in a wide range of scientific findings and integrate leading theoretical models (PP, GWT, Embodiment). Concurrently, EPET shows deep structural compatibility with fundamental Buddhist principles (*Anattā*, *Anicca*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*, *Khandhas* analysis). This convergence suggests EPET's potential heuristic value and plausibility as an integrative theory of consciousness.
