# 5. Argumentation and Empirical Support for EPET

EPET aims for internal coherence, empirical correspondence, and conceptual consistency. This section provides argumentation supporting EPET's central theses, demonstrating their links to contemporary scientific research and compatibility with key Buddhist principles, which guided the theory's development.

## 5.1. Support for Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

**5.1.1. Emergence and Processuality:**  
EPET's view of consciousness as an emergent, dynamic process finds broad support.

-   **Scientific data:** Consciousness demonstrably depends on the functioning brain (lesion/anesthesia data [@plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005]), develops gradually [@trevarthenInfantIntersubjectivityResearch2001], and relies on dynamic neural activity (EEG/MEG showing complex patterns [@varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001]). Furthermore, levels of consciousness correlate with measures of neural complexity and integration [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016], consistent with an **emergent process view** rather than a fundamental property.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This view resonates strongly with the Buddhist understanding of consciousness as a constantly changing flow, reflecting the principle of ***Anicca*** (impermanence), and as a phenomenon that arises conditionally based on other factors, not as a static entity, which is central to the doctrine of ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** (dependent origination) [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012; @bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].
    

**5.1.2. Embodiment:**  
The thesis linking consciousness to the body and action is well-supported.

-   **Scientific data:** **Interoception** is crucial for emotions and self-awareness [@craigHowYouFeel2009]; **enactivist approaches** emphasize perception as action-oriented [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004]; bodily states clearly influence conscious experience [@damasioDescartesError2006]. This supports the idea that consciousness is not merely brain-bound.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This emphasis on embodiment finds a parallel in Buddhist phenomenological analysis, such as the importance attributed to *rūpa* (materiality/the physical body) as one of the fundamental **aggregates** (*khandhas*) of experience, and the centrality of *vedanā* (feeling tone/valence), often closely linked to bodily states, in structuring subjective experience [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

**5.1.3. Predictive Modeling (PP) as the Core:**  
Using PP as the core mechanism relies on its significant explanatory power.

-   **Scientific data:** PP successfully explains various perceptual phenomena (illusions, expectation effects), action control, and attention mechanisms [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]. Neural evidence for prediction and error signals (e.g., Mismatch Negativity - MMN) is accumulating [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007].
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** The active, constructive nature of PP, wherein internal models shape perception and experience, offers a conceptual parallel to the Buddhist concept of *saṅkhāra* (mental formations or volitional fabrications) as processes that actively shape and condition subjective experience [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

**5.1.4. Content of Consciousness = Content of the Model:**  
The idea that we perceive the model's output, not raw data, is supported by:

-   **Scientific data:** PP provides compelling explanations for phenomena like hallucinations (as strong priors overriding sensory evidence) [@sterzerPredictiveCodingAccount2018]. The neural correlates of specific conscious content often map onto brain areas involved in generating high-level representations or models [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017].
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This view is conceptually harmonious with the role attributed to *saññā* (perception/recognition/conceptualization) in Buddhist psychology, which involves classifying and interpreting sensory input based on past experience, thereby contributing to the constructed 'model' of the world that we consciously perceive [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

**5.1.5. Role of Prediction Errors and Precision (Attention):**  
The functional roles ascribed to prediction errors and precision are empirically supported.

-   **Scientific data:** Specific neural responses correlate with prediction errors [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007]. Attention demonstrably modulates neural responses in ways consistent with **precision weighting** [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010], prioritizing certain information streams.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** The mechanism of modulating precision, central to attention in PP, finds a functional parallel in Buddhist descriptions of mental factors involved in directing and focusing the mind, such as *manasikāra* (attention or mental application), although EPET does not rely on a direct mapping of such specific technical terms [@wallaceAttentionRevolutionUnlocking2006].
    

**5.1.6. Global Availability (GWT) for Integration and Access:**  
Using GWT for integration and access is grounded in its empirical support.

-   **Scientific data:** Conscious perception correlates with late, widespread neural activation ("ignition," P3b component), involving prefrontal-parietal networks, consistent with broadcasting in a **global workspace** [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005; @dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014]. Split-brain studies highlight the role of large-scale integration for unified conscious access [@gazzanigaCerebralSpecializationInterhemispheric2000]. Furthermore, empirical studies of mindfulness meditation [@lutzAttentionRegulationMonitoring2008; @tangNeuroscienceMindfulnessMeditation2015] reveal systematic modulations in attention networks and DMN connectivity, findings that EPET can account for through mechanisms like shifts in the precision-weighting of interoceptive versus exteroceptive prediction errors, illustrating how alterations in self-model stability give rise to distinct conscious states.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** From a conceptual standpoint, GWT offers a plausible functional architecture for understanding how diverse aspects of experience—which Buddhist phenomenology analyzes, for example, via the framework of the five *khandhas* (aggregates)—might become integrated into the unified field of moment-to-moment consciousness (a function associated with *viññāṇa* or discernment) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

## 5.2. Support for Thesis 2: Integration and Unity of Experience without a Substantial "Self"

**5.2.1. Unity as Functional Integration:**  
Explaining unity via dynamic integration avoids positing a central self.

-   **Scientific data:** Neural synchronization [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999], recurrent processing [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], and global availability (GWT) [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] are proposed mechanisms for solving the 'binding problem' (integrating features into unified percepts) [@treismanBindingProblem1996].
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This functional explanation of unity, which does not require a central, substantial self, is fully compatible with the core Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā** (no-self).
    

**5.2.2. Absence of a Substantial "Self" (Anattā):**  
EPET's rejection of a substantial self aligns with both science and Buddhism.

-   **Scientific data:** Neuroscience finds no single brain center corresponding to a "self"; self-related processing involves distributed networks like the Default Mode Network (DMN) [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015].
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This rejection of a substantial self is a direct articulation of the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of **Anattā** [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @collinsSelflessPersonsImagery1982].
    

**5.2.3. "Self" as a Construct of Self-Modeling:**  
The view of the self as a dynamic construct of predictive self-modeling is supported by converging evidence.

-   **Scientific data:** Theoretical development of **self-modeling** within the PP framework is advancing [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]. Neuropsychological conditions like anosognosia demonstrate dissociations in self-awareness [@fotopoulouImplicitAwarenessAnosognosia2010]. Strikingly, ASC studies report experiences of **"ego dissolution"**, interpreted as temporary disruption of self-models, under psychedelics or deep meditation [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014]. For example, Nour et al. [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016] report that psilocybin-induced ego-dissolution correlates with reduced integrity of the default-mode network, which EPET interprets as a transient breakdown of high-level self-model priors, thereby supporting the view of the self as a dynamically generated construct rather than a substantive entity.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This view of the self as a constructed phenomenon resonates strongly with the role attributed to *saṅkhāra* (mental formations/volitional activities) in Buddhist thought, which are seen as constructing mental formations, including the sense of a persistent "I," and helps explain why this sense can feel so compelling despite its ultimately fabricated nature [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

## 5.3. Support for the Explanation of Qualia (Section 4)

**5.3.1. Qualia as Properties of the Process:**  
Viewing qualia as intrinsic properties of the modeling process finds support.

-   **Scientific data:** Specific **qualia** reliably correlate with activity in specific neural systems (e.g., V4/color [@zekiVisionBrain1993], insula/affect [@craigHowYouFeel2009]). The observed **plasticity of qualia** during ASCs [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014] supports the idea that qualia reflect the *current state* of the modeling process, rather than being fixed entities. Moreover, Carhart-Harris et al. [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014] demonstrate that psychedelic states exhibit increased neural entropy and markedly altered phenomenological qualities; EPET explains this by the re-weighting of precision signals in predictive hierarchies, directly linking qualia variability to the dynamics of hierarchical inference processes.
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This view is harmonious with a Buddhist phenomenological perspective that understands the qualitative aspects of experience, such as those associated with *vedanā* (feeling tone/valence) and *saññā* (perception/recognition), not as static entities but as characteristics of the dependently arisen (conditioned by *Paṭiccasamuppāda* or dependent origination) process of experience itself.
    

Furthermore, EPET's framework can generate specific predictions regarding existing experimental paradigms. For instance, studies using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt activity in nodes of the Default Mode Network (DMN) [@northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006; @raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015] should, according to EPET's Thesis 2.3, specifically impair tasks requiring stable predictive self-modeling (e.g., judgments about personality traits, autobiographical memory coherence, or agency attribution) to a greater extent than tasks relying on external sensory processing. The magnitude of this impairment should correlate with TMS parameters influencing the disruption of predictive model stability within the DMN. Such targeted predictions allow for further empirical validation or refinement of EPET using established methodologies.

**5.3.2. Dimensions of Qualia (Specificity, Intensity, Valence):**  
Mapping phenomenal dimensions to process parameters is plausible.

-   **Scientific data:** Specificity correlates with activity patterns/locations; intensity often correlates with signal amplitude/synchrony/precision; valence strongly correlates with activity in interoceptive and limbic networks involved in evaluating bodily states and relevance. [Further specific references could strengthen this, but the general correlations are established].
    
-   **Buddhist concepts:** This mapping of phenomenal dimensions to process parameters finds a conceptual parallel in the traditional Buddhist analysis of experience into the five *khandhas* (aggregates), where different aggregates are seen to contribute different characteristic dimensions (e.g., *saññā* relating to specificity, *vedanā* to valence) to the overall constitution of a conscious moment [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].
    

## 5.4. Section Conclusion
This overview demonstrates that EPET's central theses are not mere speculations but are grounded in a wide range of scientific findings and integrate leading theoretical models (PP, GWT, Embodiment). Concurrently, EPET demonstrates significant conceptual resonance with fundamental Buddhist principles such as **Anattā** (no-self), **Anicca** (impermanence), **Paṭiccasamuppāda** (dependent origination), and the phenomenological analysis of experience via the *khandhas* (aggregates). This convergence suggests EPET's potential heuristic value and plausibility as an integrative theory of consciousness.
