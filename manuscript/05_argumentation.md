# 5. Argumentation and Empirical Support for EPET

The Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET) aims not only for internal coherence but also for correspondence with empirical data and conceptual consistency with relevant philosophical traditions. This section presents arguments supporting EPET's central theses, demonstrating their connection to contemporary scientific research and compatibility with key principles of Buddhism, which served as one of the guiding criteria during the theory's development.

## 5.1. Support for Thesis 1: Consciousness as an Emergent, Dynamic, Embodied, Integrated Predictive Process

**5.1.1. Emergence and Processuality:**
EPET's position on consciousness as an emergent and dynamic process finds broad support.

*   **Scientific data:** The dependence of consciousness on a functioning brain is undeniable (data from lesions, anesthesia [@plumDiagnosisStuporComa1982; @laureysNeuralCorrelateAwareness2005]), the gradual development of consciousness [@trevarthenInfantIntersubjectivityResearch2001], the dynamic nature of neural activity (EEG/MEG) [@varelaBrainwebPhaseSynchronization2001], the correlation between the level of consciousness and the complexity/integration of activity [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Correspondence with ***Anicca*** (impermanence) [@harveyIntroductionBuddhismTeachings2012] and ***Paṭiccasamuppāda*** (dependent origination) [@bodhiTranscendentalDependentArising1980].

**5.1.2. Embodiment:**
The thesis of the inseparable link between consciousness, the body, and action is supported by abundant data.

*   **Scientific data:** The role of interoception [@craigHowYouFeel2009] in emotions and self-awareness, data from enactivism and active perception [@varelafranciscoEmbodiedMindCognitive1991; @noeActionPerception2004], the influence of bodily states on consciousness [@damasioDescartesError2006].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Correspondence with the importance of ***Rūpa*** (body) and ***Vedanā*** (connection to bodily state) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.3. Predictive Modeling (PP) as the Core:**
The use of PP as EPET's primary mechanism relies on its growing explanatory power.

*   **Scientific data:** The explanatory power of PP for perception (illusions, expectations), action, attention [@fristonFreeenergyPrincipleUnified2010; @clarkWhateverNextPredictive2013; @hohwyPredictiveMind2013]; neural evidence of prediction and error signals (MMN, etc.) [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Analogy with the active construction of experience (***Saṅkhāra***) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.4. Content of Consciousness = Content of the Model:**
The thesis that we are conscious of the content of our predictive model is supported by several facts.

*   **Scientific data:** Explanation of hallucinations [@sterzerPredictiveCodingAccount2018], the link between the NCC of content and modeling areas [@tononiIntegratedInformationTheory2016; @kochConsciousnessConfessionsRomantic2017].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Correspondence with the role of ***Saññā*** (recognition/conceptualization) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

**5.1.5. Role of Prediction Errors and Precision (Attention):**

*   **Scientific data:** Neural correlates of errors [@naatanenMismatchNegativityMMN2007], modulation of attention (precision) [@feldmanAttentionUncertaintyFreeenergy2010].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Correspondence with ***Manasikāra*** (attention) [see analysis in @wallaceAttentionRevolutionUnlocking2006].

**5.1.6. Global Availability (GWT) for Integration and Access:**
The use of the GWT mechanism to explain access and integration is based on data from this theory.

*   **Scientific data:** Supported by the sharp amplification and propagation of neural activation ("ignition," P3b) upon conscious perception of a stimulus [@dehaeneCerebralMechanismsWord2001; @sergentTimingBrainEvents2005], the special role of prefrontal-parietal networks in conscious report and control [@dehaeneConsciousnessBrainDeciphering2014], as well as data from "split-brain" patients [@gazzanigaCerebralSpecializationInterhemispheric2000] demonstrating the importance of interhemispheric integration for the unity of conscious access.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** GWT provides a plausible neural mechanism for explaining how different aspects of experience, analyzed through the ***Khandhas***, are integrated into a unified field of consciousness (***Viññāṇa***) [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

## 5.2. Support for Thesis 2: Integration and Unity of Experience without a Substantial "Self"

**5.2.1. Unity as Functional Integration:**

*   **Scientific data:** The role of synchronization [@singerNeuronalSynchronyVersatile1999], recurrence [@lammeDistinctModesVision2000], and global availability (GWT) [@baarsCognitiveTheoryConsciousness1993] in information binding (the binding problem) [@treismanBindingProblem1996].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Explanation of unity without positing a "self," consistent with ***Anattā***.

**5.2.2. Absence of a Substantial "Self" (*Anattā*):**

*   **Scientific data:** Absence of a single "self center" in the brain [see review in @northoffSelfreferentialProcessingOur2006], connection of the sense of self with distributed networks (DMN, etc.) [@raichleBrainsDefaultMode2015].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Direct correspondence with the doctrine of ***Anattā*** [@rahulaWhatBuddhaTaught2007; @collinsSelflessPersonsImagery1982].

**5.2.3. "Self" as a Construct of Self-Modeling (PP + *Saṅkhāra*):**

*   **Scientific data:** Development of self-modeling ideas within PP [@hohwyPredictiveMind2013; @sethBeingYouNew2021]; neuropsychological syndromes of impaired self-awareness (anosognosia, etc.) [@fotopoulouImplicitAwarenessAnosognosia2010]; ASC data on **ego dissolution** [@nourEgodissolutionPsychedelicsValidation2016; @carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014] as a result of disrupted self-modeling.
*   **Buddhist concepts:** The mechanism of constructing the sense of self through ***Saṅkhāra*** [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000], explaining the illusion of a permanent "self."

## 5.3. Support for the Explanation of Qualia (Section 4)

**5.3.1. Qualia as Properties of the Process:**

*   **Scientific data:** Correlation of specific qualia with the activity of specific neural systems (V4 for color [@zekiVisionBrain1993], insula for affect [@craigHowYouFeel2009]); **plasticity of qualia** in ASCs as a reflection of changes in the modeling process [@carhart-harrisEntropicBrainTheory2014].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Realization of the qualities of ***Vedanā*** and ***Saññā*** through the properties of a process arising **dependently (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*)**.

**5.3.2. Dimensions of Qualia (Specificity, Intensity, Valence):**

*   **Scientific data:** Correlation of these dimensions with parameters of neural activity (specificity - region/pattern, intensity - amplitude/precision, valence - limbic/interoceptive networks). [Specific research references could be added here for reinforcement, but currently relying on general points from previous sections].
*   **Buddhist concepts:** Correspondence with the analysis of the ***Khandhas*** [@bodhiComprehensiveManualAbhidhamma2000].

## 5.4. Section Conclusion

The presented overview shows that the central theses of EPET are not speculative constructions. They find support in a wide range of contemporary scientific data and integrate leading theoretical models (PP, GWT, Embodiment). Simultaneously, EPET's key propositions demonstrate deep structural compatibility with the fundamental philosophical and psychological principles of Buddhism (*Anattā*, *Anicca*, *Paṭiccasamuppāda*, analysis of the *Khandhas*). This convergence of data and concepts from different fields of knowledge attests to the potential heuristic value and plausibility of EPET as an integrative theory of consciousness.
