abstract: |
  This paper introduces the Emergent Predictive Experience Theory (EPET), an integrative framework addressing the hard problem of consciousness from a non-reductive emergentist physicalist perspective. EPET uniquely synthesizes insights from Predictive Processing (PP), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), embodied cognition, and core Buddhist philosophical principles (like Anattā, no-self). The theory posits consciousness as a real, emergent, dynamic process realized through integrated predictive modeling in an embodied, action-oriented system. Through a constitutive account, EPET explains subjective qualities (qualia) as intrinsic properties of this modeling process, reflecting the system's assessment of interaction relevance. The phenomenal self is interpreted as a dynamic construct from recursive self-modeling, compatible with the Anattā doctrine. By integrating these scientific and philosophical perspectives, EPET provides a coherent, naturalistic, and empirically testable explanation of conscious experience, avoiding common metaphysical pitfalls and offering a valuable framework for future interdisciplinary research.
